<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This study
begins by outlining the foundational principles of U.S. taxation and tracing
their evolution from the early republic to the modern income tax.</span> <span
>It then turns to the empirical record of
major statutory tax changes from 1913 to 2000. Across a century of policy
shifts, the same pattern emerges: reported income, the tax base, and federal
receipts adjust systematically in response to the incentives embedded in the
law. The analysis focuses on episodes in which Congress altered rates,
exemptions, or the structure of taxable income on a scale large enough to
reveal clear behavioral responses. Because single-episode estimates are
inherently sensitive to timing and anticipation effects, a longer-run,
multi-episode comparison reduces this sensitivity by requiring timing-based
explanations to account for repeated, directionally consistent reversals across
distinct statutory regimes.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The inquiry
draws on original IRS Statistics of Income tabulations, Treasury rate
schedules, OMB Historical Tables, and contemporaneous legislative records.
Because these sources capture reported taxable income rather than total income,
the analysis interprets their movements as behavioral signals rather than
direct measures of inequality or ability to pay. Inflation regimes, bracket
creep, shelter use, and statutory complexity materially affect these signals
and are accounted for throughout. A detailed methodological appendix describes
the deflators, data conventions, and comparability limitations that govern
cross-era interpretation.</span></p>

<p><span >By examining both the periods
in which incentives improved and those in which they weakened, the analysis
evaluates</span> <span >how changes in
rate structures, base definitions, and monetary conditions shaped taxpayer
behavior throughout the twentieth century. The narrative does not assign
single-cause explanations for macroeconomic cycles or fiscal outcomes. But the data
show that incentives built into the tax system influence reported income and
the stability—or fragility—of the tax base. The result is an empirical account
of how a century of American tax policy, in conjunction with broader economic
conditions, produced recurrent patterns in taxpayer behavior that remain
relevant to contemporary debates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p style='margin:0in'><u><span ><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Across the
modern era, the individual income tax has supplied the largest single share of
federal revenue. Payroll taxes account for much of the remainder, with total
taxation providing roughly ninety to ninety-five percent of federal receipts.
In short, there is no government without taxation; every function of public
policy is financed either through current collections or through debt.
Understanding what tax policy can—and cannot—accomplish therefore requires
examining the historical record with precision. Moreover, fiscal policy always
operates within the context of the monetary framework, so while the tax code
remains the primary focus, monetary policy will be noted where appropriate.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><u><span ><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Since the
nation’s founding, debates over taxation have been framed in moral terms: who
should pay, how much, and what constitutes a “fair share?” The phrase has
endured because it appeals to intuition more than to evidence. Yet behind these
arguments lies a measurable record. The history of the federal income tax shows
how taxpayers respond to changing incentives and how rate structures shape the
behavior that determines reported income and revenue.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Public
discussion often turns on labels such as “the rich” and “fair share,” yet both
are inherently subjective. A household deemed “rich” by statutory definition
may, in practical terms, be only moderately affluent once obligations and
regional costs are considered. Likewise, there is no consensus definition of
what constitutes a “fair share.” Tax policy is not an abstraction—it shapes the
choices of individuals, families, businesses, and the outcomes of trillions of
transactions. When the mechanisms that govern income reporting are left
unexamined, claims of inequity risk resting on perception rather than on
primary evidence.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Accordingly,
this study approaches the income tax system through administrative data rather
than ideological priors. Drawing directly from the Treasury’s Statistics of
Income, it examines taxpayer behavior in response to major shifts in statutory
marginal rates. Across the century, a recurring pattern emerges: when rates for
top earners fall significantly, taxable income and the revenue they generate
tend to rise; when rates are sharply elevated, avoidance, deferral, and
underreporting proliferate. These outcomes reflect empirical regularities
grounded in rational behavioral responses rather than normative theory. Where
useful, distributional series are referenced to compare observed behavioral
patterns with later interpretive frameworks. Analyses that reconstruct
comprehensive income distributions from national accounts address a different
question than the one examined here and require assumptions about incidence and
allocation that are not invariant to the tax-induced behavioral responses
documented in this study.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This is not
a comprehensive history of American taxation. It is an empirical inquiry into
how taxation in practice has diverged from several of the principles originally
intended to guide it and the behavioral effects that accompanied successive
changes in tax legislation. The focus is on fiscal actions that materially
reshaped individual income tax rates and the consequences of those changes as
reflected in the data. Because all taxes shape incentives and constraints,
corporate, capital gains, excise, and state taxes are noted where relevant.
Background conditions are discussed only insofar as they bear directly on the
interpretation of those responses. The degree of contextual attention
necessarily varies across periods, reflecting differences in prevailing
misconceptions rather than differences in evidentiary standards. Periods not
examined in depth are omitted for analytical relevance, not neglect. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The analysis
relies uniformly on original SOI aggregates, free from smoothing or
normalization. The aim is to observe behavioral responses as experienced by
taxpayers—without asserting causality for business cycles, inequality trends,
or macroeconomic conditions. Major developments—such as postwar expansion or
late-century productivity growth—reflect a confluence of fiscal, monetary,
geopolitical, and structural forces beyond the scope of this inquiry. While it
is impossible to survey such a span of history without reference to external
events, firm counterfactuals are avoided. Where possible, figures are
cross-checked against independent sources, and discrepancies are noted.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >All data
presented here are open to interpretation. Economic outcomes reflect many
interacting forces, and no single factor operates in isolation. This study does
not attempt a full causal reconstruction or engage in econometric modeling—no
regressions, elasticity estimates, or counterfactual simulations are developed.
The inferences drawn are historical and empirical, based on observable changes
in reported income, participation, and revenue as statutory rates changed. The
focus is confined to what can be measured with minimal ambiguity and to
clarifying several persistent misconceptions about past tax policy—distortions
that have shaped public understanding more than the record itself. Throughout,
emphasis is placed on contemporaneous documents, original data, and the policy rationale
understood by those who enacted the laws. Where direct quotations illuminate
intent or reveal inconsistencies between theory and result, they are included. Ultimately,
the evidence speaks for itself: when theory is written into law, the words are
on record, and the results that follow are fixed in fact.</span></p>

<h2 id="historical-overview-of-the-income-tax-in-america">Historical Overview of the Income Tax in America</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Any
assessment of the income tax must begin with its origins and constitutional
grounding. Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provides:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><em><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
font-style:normal'>&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><em><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;font-style:normal'>The Congress shall
have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the
Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the
United States.</span></em></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><i><span >                  </span></i></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Although
taxation in various forms has existed since the nation’s founding, the federal
individual income tax is a relatively recent innovation. From the country’s
inception through 1860, no tax was levied directly on personal income. The
income tax first appeared in a moment of national emergency, during the Civil
War, as a temporary measure to generate the additional revenue needed to fund
wartime expenditures.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Despite the
Framers’ emphasis on uniform taxation, the first federal income tax arose from
wartime necessity rather than constitutional design. Under the Revenue Act of
1861, Congress imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $800 to help finance
the Union effort. The following year, the Revenue Act of 1862 replaced the flat
rate with a graduated structure: 3 percent on earnings above $600 and 5 percent
on incomes exceeding $10,000. These provisions remained in effect through 1866,
though the Revenue Act of 1864 introduced an intermediate 7.5 percent rate on
incomes between $5,000 and $10,000.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
departure from uniformity provoked serious debate in Congress. Many lawmakers
regarded progressive rates as incompatible with the nation’s founding
principles. Vermont Representative Justin Morrill argued that taxing higher
incomes at graduated rates violated the basic American commitment to equality.
He insisted that “on all other subjects we tax men alike,” and observed that no
state “taxes a producer more because he produces more than his neighbor. No
State has ever taxed on this principle or ever will.” Such a system, he warned,
contradicted “the very theory of our institutions,” which “make no distinction
between the rich man and the poor man.” Progressive taxation, he contended,
effectively “seizes property of men for the crime of having too much” and
reflected “the spirit of agrarianism” rather than the constitutional premise of
equal treatment.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>1</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Civil
War ended in 1865, but the income tax persisted until its repeal in 1872. By
then, it had become deeply unpopular, regarded as an emergency wartime measure
rather than a permanent component of federal finance. Yet its brief existence
inaugurated ongoing debates among legislators, jurists, and economists over the
meaning of constitutional uniformity and the proper structure of the American
tax system. Setting aside the merits of those debates, a few facts about the
income tax’s foundations are clear. First, taxation on income was originally
reserved for periods of war or national crisis to raise necessary revenue. This
is evident from the absence of any income tax prior to the Civil War and during
the long peacetime interval from 1873 to 1912. The lone exception was the
Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, which imposed a 2 percent flat tax on incomes
above $4,000. One year later, the Supreme Court, in </span><em><span
>Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust Co.</span></em><span
> (1895), ruled 5–4 that the levy was
unconstitutional, effectively nullifying it.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Second, the
text of Article I, Section 8 declares that “all Duties, Imposts and Excises
shall be uniform throughout the United States.” The initial federal income tax
was enacted at a single uniform rate, before wartime mobilization later
expanded it into a graduated structure. Post–Civil War legislators also appeared
to take this instruction at face value and applied it to the income tax as a
matter of policy, maintaining a single flat rate rather than a graduated
schedule. From 1867 to 1869, a uniform rate of 5 percent was levied on incomes
above $1,000; from 1870 to 1872, this was reduced to 2.5 percent on incomes
above $2,000. Yet the appearance of uniformity was limited. Although the rate
was identical for all tax units subject to it, the law applied only to a narrow
segment of the population—the upper-income minority—thereby departing from the general
spirit of uniformity that implied impartial contribution across the polity. The
period nevertheless reflected a lingering adherence to the principle that tax
rates, once imposed, should not vary among those within the taxable class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >The principle
of uniformity was also reflected at the state and local levels. Richard
Theodore Ely, writing in 1888 during the pre–income tax era, contended that the
period from 1796 to the Civil War marked “the complete establishment of the
American system of state and local taxation,” the defining feature of which was
“the taxation of all property, movable and immovable, visible and invisible…at
one uniform rate.” <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>2</span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The practice
of levying uniform taxes on tangible property was later abandoned in many
states as legislatures began experimenting with differentiated assessments for
various classes of property. Whatever the rationale for this
shift—administrative, political, or otherwise—it represented a departure from
the earlier tradition in which uniform rates were applied across all forms of
taxable property. That tradition is important: it shows that the principle
underlying Article I, Section 8 once had broad expression in American fiscal
practice, even at the state level. The Constitution was never amended to repeal
or replace this clause, though jurisprudence gradually narrowed its meaning in
the early nineteenth century, and legislators moved even further from its
spirit in the early twentieth. Modest graduation reflected evolving views of
equity, but a clear distinction separates incremental adjustments in tax
burdens from the confiscatory rates that, at their peak, exceeded 90 percent.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
possibility for abuse was not lost on the Founders. Having lived under imperial
rule and studied the excesses of monarchs and absolute governments, they
understood that the power to tax carried the potential to oppress.</span> <span
>The American Revolution itself was
sparked in part by taxes imposed without colonial representation. After
independence, the Framers confronted the challenge of building a government
with checks and balances strong enough to guard against such dangers. Long
before the testimony of Representative Morrill, James Madison cautioned in </span><em><span
>The Federalist No. 10</span></em><span
> that “the apportionment of taxes on the
various descriptions of property…requires the most exact impartiality,” yet no
legislative act offered “greater opportunity and temptation…to a predominant
party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they
overburden the inferior number is a shilling saved to their own pockets.” <a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>3</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Echoing
those sentiments, Thomas Jefferson, writing in 1816, articulated a principled
standard for taxation rooted in equal application.</span> <span
>Once a society determined whether taxes
should fall on property, on surplus beyond basic needs, or on the “faculties of
body and mind” through annual earnings, he maintained that the chosen principle
“is to be equally and fairly applied to all.” Jefferson argued that to “take
from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers
has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have
not exercised equal industry and skill,” was an arbitrary violation of “the
first principle of association”—the guarantee that every person may freely
exercise industry and enjoy its fruits. If large accumulations of wealth were
ever deemed dangerous, he concluded that the proper remedy was equal
inheritance laws, which he called “a law of nature,” rather than punitive
“extra-taxation,” which violated it.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>4</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >While the
Framers conceived of uniformity in civic and moral terms, the courts construed
it more narrowly from the outset. In Hylton v. United States (1796), the first
case to interpret the Constitution’s tax provisions, the Supreme Court held
that “uniform throughout the United States” required only that a federal excise
apply with the same force in every state—a reading later reaffirmed in Knowlton
v. Moore (1900). This judicial interpretation did not address the broader
philosophical understanding of uniformity but confined the clause’s enforceable
meaning to territorial consistency.</span> <span >The
distinct conception of impartiality among citizens, what Madison and Jefferson
regarded as the essence of fairness in taxation, was thus displaced by a
technical standard of geographic application. To Madison and Jefferson alike,
uniformity represented impartial justice among citizens. It was a moral
safeguard against partial legislation, not a technical condition of geography.
The shift from moral to administrative uniformity marks one of the earliest
divides between the founding philosophy of taxation and its later
constitutional jurisprudence.</span></p>

<p><span >In addition to the moral
considerations surrounding taxation, the practical consequences of punitive
rates were recognized before the United States existed. In his 1756 essay “<i>Of
Taxes</i>,” Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume warned of the
destructive effects of excessive levies on production and industry. “Exorbitant
taxes,” he wrote, “like extreme necessity, destroy industry, by producing
despair; and even before they reach this pitch, they raise the wages of the
labourer and manufacturer, and heighten the price of all commodities.” A wise
legislature, he argued, would seek the point “when the emolument ceases, and
the prejudice begins,” yet because “the contrary character is much more
common,” he feared that taxes across Europe were multiplying to a degree that
would “entirely crush all art and industry.” <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>5</span></a></span></p>

<p><span >Hume’s warning anticipated the
same tension later recognized by the Framers: that taxation, when extended
beyond necessity or equity, ceases to sustain the common good and begins to
suppress the very industry upon which national prosperity depends. Fellow
Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith identified the same premises two
decades later in </span><span class=MsoBookTitle><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
font-weight:normal'>The Wealth of Nations</span></span><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'> (1776). He observed that direct taxes on wages often led
not to proportional increases in pay but to “a considerable fall in the demand
of labour,” producing “the declension of industry, the decrease of employment
for the poor, [and] the diminution of the annual produce of the land and labour
of the country.” Even when wages did rise, he noted, their higher price and the
profit of those advancing them “must always be finally paid by the landlords
and consumers.” <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>6</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Smith
further warned that excessively high taxes often yielded less revenue than
moderate ones. “High taxes,” he wrote, “sometimes by diminishing the
consumption of the taxed commodities, and sometimes by encouraging smuggling,
frequently afford a smaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from
more moderate taxes.” In such cases, he concluded, “there can be but one
remedy, and that is the lowering of the tax.” <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>7</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Hume and
Smith articulated the economic mechanism. Both concluded that taxation, when
carried beyond moderation, harms the ends it purports to serve—industry,
employment, and the fiscal health of the state. Their insights anticipated
concerns later voiced by American political thinkers, who framed uniformity as
a safeguard against partial legislation. The Founders also advanced a moral
boundary that mirrored the underlying economic constraint. What follows
examines whether those cautions proved prescient. The historical record of the
income tax—its rate structures, incentives, and outcomes—offers a measurable
test of ideas first articulated in theory.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >From 1913
through 1916, the principal income measure was “Gross Income,” with deductions
not allocated to specific sources but reported in aggregate under “Deductions.”
From 1917 through 1943, the principal income measure shifted to “Net Income,” a
precursor to what would later become Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Beginning in
1944, the system adopted AGI as the primary baseline, which remains in use
today. Where definitional changes affect comparability across years, they are

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Congressional
party composition and recorded voting patterns appear where they illuminate the
political path of major tax changes. Although public commentary often
attributes ownership of tax policy to the president in office, Article I,
Section 7 of the Constitution assigns origination of revenue bills to the House
of Representatives; the Senate may amend and concur. This is noted only to
clarify institutional responsibility, not to assign credit or blame.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Throughout
this work, the term tax cut(s) refers to reductions in marginal tax rates, not necessarily
to changes in total liabilities or revenues. In practice, the marginal tax rate
facing higher-income tax units reflected the combined effect of the normal tax
and the applicable surtax. The marginal rate is the percentage applied to the
next dollar of income earned above the statutory threshold. Distinguishing
marginal rates from aggregate collections is essential, as the historical record
repeatedly shows that reductions in marginal rates can coincide with rising
federal receipts, while higher marginal rates do not reliably produce increased
revenue.</span></p>

<h2 id="reinstitution-of-the-income-tax-and-world-war-i">Reinstitution of the Income Tax and World War I</h2>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Three
landmark events occurred in 1913 that would profoundly shape the nation’s
economic and political trajectory. That year saw the ratification of the
Sixteenth Amendment and the passage of both the Federal Reserve Act and the
Revenue Act of 1913—measures that together redefined the structure of American
finance, governance, and taxation for the remainder of the twentieth century.</span>
<span >The former established a central
banking system through the creation of the Federal Reserve; the latter two
reinstituted the federal income tax after nearly four decades of absence.
Following years of contentious debate, the Revenue Act was passed by the 63rd
Congress—then under Democratic control in both chambers and a supermajority in
the House of Representatives. </span></p>

<p><span >The 1913 Act substantially
reduced import tariffs and reestablished a federal income tax with a graduated
rate structure. Signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson, the measure was
publicly framed in terms of equity, though its immediate purpose was to replace
revenue lost from lower tariffs. Import duties, then the government’s primary
source of revenue, accounted for roughly half of annual receipts but were
widely viewed by Democrats as regressive, disproportionately burdening ordinary
consumers. Reducing the average tariff rate from 40 to 27 percent and replacing
part of that revenue with a levy “intended to shift the burden of taxation to
those best able to bear it”</span> <span >was
seen as a corrective. </span></p>

<p><span >Reinstituting an income tax
aimed at the affluent was far from universally welcomed. During Senate debate,
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts warned that the new levy risked inflaming
class resentment and undermining the moral legitimacy of property rights. “It
will be an evil day for us,” he cautioned, “when we enter on confiscation of
property under the guise of taxation. What we want to do is raise money for the
support of the government.” To impose taxes “for vindictive reasons,” simply to
punish those who had “succeeded and accumulated property by thrift and
intelligence and character,” he argued, would convert a revenue measure into “a
pillage of a class.” Lodge rejected the notion that wealth honestly earned was
a mark of guilt: “I know the present tone is that any man who has money is
prima facie a criminal… But there has been in this country for many years, and
there is today…a great deal of honest success honestly won. There have been
great fortunes honestly made and wisely and benevolently distributed… I think
they are entitled to the fruits of their success… It will be an ill day for
this country when we raise the cry that success honestly won is to be punished;
that money honestly gained is the badge of criminality; and that we…say to [the
people]: ‘Follow us. We will plunder the people who have got the money. You
shall spend it, and it will not cost you anything.’ That is a dangerous cry…
for when you unchain that force you cannot tell where it will stop… you may
bring your boasted civilization down in ruins about you.” <a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>8</span></a></span></p>

<p><span >Despite the protests of Senator
Lodge and other likeminded opponents, the personal income tax was reinstituted.
Accompanying the Revenue Act of 1913 was the Sixteenth Amendment, which had
been proposed by Congress in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913, removing
the constitutional barrier to a federal income tax. It reads: “The Congress
shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to
any census or enumeration.” This amendment effectively nullified the
apportionment restriction contained in Article I, Section 9, which had rendered
earlier income taxes unconstitutional. Though it left untouched Article I, Section
8, which preserved Congress’s general taxing authority over duties, imposts,
and excises. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
amendment also did not alter the uniformity requirement of Section 8; that
provision remained in the text but lost practical force through interpretation.
In </span><em><span >Brushaber v. Union
Pacific Railroad Co.</span></em><span >
(1916), the Supreme Court held that the clause required only geographic, not
rate, uniformity. By that reasoning, graduated income taxation became </span><strong><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;font-weight:normal'>de facto
constitutional through judicial acceptance</span></strong><b><span
>, </span></b><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>not </span><strong><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
font-weight:normal'>de jure constitutional through textual revision</span></strong><span
>. The strictly uniform system of federal
taxation conceived by the Framers thus evolved, by construction of the courts, into
a progressive one.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Marginal
rates under the 1913 law were modest, ranging from 1 percent on income above
the personal exemption and below $20,000 to 7 percent on income exceeding
$500,000. The exemption was set at $3,000 for individuals and $4,000 for
married couples. Because so few Americans earned above those thresholds, fewer
than 1 percent of Americans filed income tax returns before World War I, and
even when measured against households or adult earners, the share never
exceeded 2 percent. These brackets remained in place through 1915, but the
Revenue Act of 1916 both multiplied the number of brackets and drastically
increased upper rates—signaling a new readiness, shaped in part by wartime
finance, to employ the income tax not merely as a source of revenue but as an
instrument of redistribution in principle. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In April
1917, the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I. The
fiscal demands of mobilization soon transformed the structure of federal
taxation. The War Revenue Act of 1917 introduced several additional income
brackets and raised rates abruptly—by as much as 300 percent for incomes exceeding
$20,000—marking the first time marginal rates exceeded 50 percent. This
development reflected a general acceptance of high taxation as permissible,
even necessary, in wartime, though its design mirrored the confiscatory pattern
that earlier opponents such as Madison, Jefferson, Morrill, and Lodge had
warned against. Simultaneously, the single filer exemption was reduced to
$1,000 and the married couple exemption to $2,000, broadening the tax base
downward considerably. </span></p>

<p><span >Although the war concluded in
November 1918, the Revenue Act of 1918—enacted in February 1919—raised rates still
further, setting the top marginal rate at 77 percent for the 1918 tax year. The
act provided for a lower schedule beginning in 1919, but while rates declined
modestly in the years that followed, they bore no resemblance to the prewar
schedule. What had begun as a narrowly targeted levy on the affluent had,
within a few years, become the central fiscal instrument for scaling federal
revenues and allocating the tax burden. By 1918, roughly 96 percent of
Americans still paid no income tax at all—a concentration of liability that
invites enduring questions about proportionality and fairness. Table 1 details
the federal individual income tax schedule from 1913 through 1921. </span></p>

<h2 id="the-mellon-tax-cuts">The Mellon Tax Cuts</h2>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >World War I
left the United States with one of the largest price-level dislocations in its
history. The consumer price index nearly doubled between the mid-1910s and 1920
during wartime mobilization, then fell sharply in the deflationary recession of
1920–1921 as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary conditions to reverse
wartime expansion. In this environment of volatile prices and contracting
output, the wartime tax structure—designed for emergency revenue extraction
rather than economic stability—had become untenable.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As
policymakers confronted the economic aftermath of wartime taxation, the burdens
of the existing system were neither abstract nor obscure. President Calvin
Coolidge, speaking in 1923, summarized the practical consequences plainly:
“High taxes reach everywhere and burden everybody. They bear most heavily upon
the poor. They diminish industry and commerce. They make agriculture
unprofitable. They increase the rates on transportation. They are a charge on
every necessary of life.” <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>9</span></a> Such observations reflected a
widespread recognition that the prevailing tax structure was constraining
productive activity and weighing most heavily on those least able to bear it—a
theme that would shape the fiscal program that followed.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Treasury
Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, appointed in 1921 by President Warren G. Harding,
mounted a sustained challenge to the prevailing system of high wartime income
and estate taxes. His objection was empirical rather than ideological, grounded
in observation rather than theory. Drawing on his long tenure in banking and
railroads, Mellon concluded that high rates discouraged the investment and
enterprise upon which national prosperity depended. Elevated rates, he
maintained, did not increase revenue but instead suppressed productive
activity, eroded savings, and ultimately harmed the broader public more than
the wealthy. He further held that a substantial reduction in surtax rates would
entail an initial decline in revenue, but that this effect would not be
permanent, as broader participation and increased taxable activity would more
than offset the loss over time.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a></span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >It would be
nearly five years before Mellon’s program was fully realized, but two
intermediate revenue acts laid the groundwork. The Revenue Act of 1921 marked
the first legislative step in that process. </span><span
class=whitespace-normal><span >President
Harding</span></span><span > openly
supported reductions in wartime tax rates and endorsed the incentive-based
rationale later associated with Mellon’s approach, framing the act as a
corrective to the revenue and investment distortions of World War I taxation.
Notable changes included:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• Capping
the top bracket at $200,000 (down from $1,000,000)<br>
• Reducing the top marginal rate from 73 percent to 58 percent<br>
• Granting modest reductions across the remaining upper-income brackets<br>
• Holding these rates constant for tax years 1922–1923</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• Creating a
distinct category for capital gains and lowering the rate from parity with the
individual rates to 12.5 percent in 1922</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Further
reductions came with the Revenue Act of 1924, which moved the system closer to
Mellon’s general aim of lower, more uniform rates. Major changes included:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• Compressing
brackets and reducing rates broadly<br>
• Setting a top marginal rate of 46 percent for income above $500,000<br>
• Cutting the middle-income rate ($4,000–$8,000) from 8 percent to 4 percent<br>
• Reducing the lowest bracket rate (taxable income above exemption but below
$4,000) from 4 percent to 2 percent</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >None of
these legislative changes came easily. Democrats and Progressives waged
determined resistance against what they viewed as an unjust rollback of wartime
progressivity. The Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 emerged as compromise
measures, the products of protracted battles within the House Ways and Means
Committee and on the floor of Congress. In their 1924 campaign literature,
Senators Robert M. La Follette and Burton K. Wheeler articulated the
opposition’s view of the Mellon tax plan in stark terms, denouncing it as “a
device to relieve multimillionaires at the expense of other taxpayers” and as
“a master effort of the special privilege mind.” They argued that the plan
would shift the tax burden downward, warning that it would “tax the poor and
relieve the rich.”</span> <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >11</span></span></a><span
> Unable to prevent passage of the bill,
Congressional Progressives and Democratic opponents demanded a concession: in
exchange for reduced rates, the act would include a provision requiring the
publication of income tax payments made by the highest earners—a public
accounting meant to expose and shame those who presumably stood to benefit most
under the new schedule.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Secretary
Mellon was not alone in his conviction that excessive taxation stifled economic
vitality. After Calvin Coolidge’s decisive victory in the 1924 presidential
election, the administration’s fiscal philosophy was unambiguous. In his 1925
Inaugural Address, Coolidge proclaimed that “the collection of any taxes which
are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to
the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. In a republic, the
rewards of industry belong to those who earn them, and the only constitutional
tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. The property of the country
belongs to the people of the country; their title is absolute. The time is
arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unless we wish to hamper
the people in their right to earn a living, we must have tax reform. The method
of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business; it ought to
encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high rates—not only because they
produce little or no revenue, but because they are bad for the country and
wrong in principle. We cannot finance the nation or improve social conditions
through any system of injustice, even if it is aimed at the rich. Those who
suffer the greatest harm will be the poor. The wise course in taxation is not
to destroy those who have already secured success, but to create conditions
under which everyone has a better chance to be successful.” <a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>12</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Unfulfilled
by the partial victories of 1921 and 1924, Secretary Mellon and his
congressional allies pressed forward.</span> <span >Ohio
Congressman Nicholas Longworth III, newly elected Speaker of the House, joined
Mellon in urging the Ways and Means Committee to complete the program of rate
reduction. Their persistence culminated in the Revenue Act of 1926, which took
effect retroactively for 1925 incomes. This legislation represented the full
realization of Mellon’s plan; it reduced the top marginal rate to 25 percent
and repealed the 1924 publicity provision. All three Revenue Acts were enacted
by Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. These alterations to the
tax schedule are illustrated in Table 2</span><i>.</i><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'> Notable modifications in the Revenue Act of 1926 included:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span ><br>
• Defining the top bracket as incomes above $100,000</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• Reducing
marginal rates across-the-board<br>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Because
Secretary Mellon later became the subject of intense criticism, including
congressional investigations during the Hoover administration, it is important
to recall how he described the aims of his program.</span> <span
>The Mellon tax cuts are the origin of
what contemporary and later critics would deride as “tax cuts for the rich.” What
is often overlooked, however, is that Mellon had envisioned the income tax as a
levy borne almost exclusively by the most affluent—and for a time, it was
exactly that. For seven consecutive years following the Revenue Act of 1926,
lower-income Americans paid little or no income tax, contributing only a
negligible share of total receipts after 1924.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Mellon
warned that “the man of large income has tended more and more to invest his
capital in such a way that the tax collector cannot reach it.” The value of
tax-exempt securities, he argued, “will be greatest in the case of the
wealthiest taxpayer” and will be “relatively worthless” to a small investor,
with the result that the cost of making up lost revenue must fall on other
taxpayers “who do not or cannot take refuge in tax-exempt securities.” It was,
in Mellon’s judgment, an “almost grotesque” outcome to impose “higher taxes on
all the rest in order to make up the resulting deficiency in the revenues.” He
repeatedly urged Congress to end such exemptions, pointing out the economic
inefficiencies these instruments created. More troubling to him still was the
democratic principle at stake. Mellon found it “repugnant” that there should
exist “a class in the community which cannot be reached for tax purposes.” He
considered it inconceivable “that a system of taxation which permits a man with
an income of $1,000,000 a year to pay not one cent to the support of his
Government should remain unaltered.” <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>13</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Andrew
Mellon, himself among the nation’s wealthiest citizens, became an obvious
target for personal attacks. Yet his position was reinforced repeatedly through
both policy and outcome. The data quickly confirmed his central claim: lower
rates could yield greater revenue from high earners while broadening productive
investment. The tax burden, which during the war years had pushed deeply into
middle- and lower-income brackets, receded abruptly upward once the postwar
rate reductions were enacted. The most dramatic evidence of this reallocation
appears in Table 3, which shows the immediate post-1924 redistribution of tax
liability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
perception of abrupt rate reductions for those at the top of the income
scale—and the public concern they prompted—may be understandable. At first
glance, such changes appeared to insulate the affluent from a proportionate
fiscal burden. But evaluating the effects of a comprehensive tax reform
requires attention to the underlying mechanics and the data that reflect them,
rather than to initial impressions.</span> <span >The
most common error in these debates is the conflation of tax rates with tax
revenue. From the government’s perspective, the purpose of taxation is to raise
sufficient revenue to finance legitimate public functions, so the relevant
question is which rate structure generates that revenue without suppressing
productive capacity. A more informed reading of the evidence shows that periods
marked by stronger incentives for production generally coincide with superior
economic performance—and that expanding prosperity, rather than intensifying
statutory claims on income, has proved the more stable foundation for federal
revenue. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The rate
schedule is now established, and the immediate shift in the tax burden is
evident in Table 3. Attention now turns to how the distributive tax burden and
revenue responded once the Revenue Act of 1926 took effect. Table 4 summarizes
what transpired in the years immediately preceding and following
implementation.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;text-align:center'><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>Table 4</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=276
214  class="table-img" src="manuscript-export-assets/image004.png"></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >There are
several contextual points essential for interpreting Table 4 and the fiscal
dynamics of the latter half of the 1920s. Nominal income tax receipts in 1919
exceeded those of any subsequent year through 1929. This outlying year
reflected immediate postwar conditions, as extraordinary wartime profits and
accumulated gains were realized and taxed under the elevated surtax rates
imposed by the Revenue Act of 1918. The episode was not indicative of any
durable revenue productivity of high statutory rates. As these temporary
realizations dissipated, reported income and tax liabilities at the top
retreated considerably. The pattern observed in the ensuing years reflects
changes in filing and reporting behavior—deferral, avoidance, and exit from the
tax base—rather than a mechanical expansion of taxable income.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >More
fundamentally, revenue outcomes are best understood as a secondary expression
of economic capacity—shaped by statutory design and taxpayer behavior—rather
than as a direct measure of economic performance. Federal revenues represent
resources transferred from the private economy to the public sector; whatever
the government collects is, by definition, no longer available for private
consumption, saving, or investment. Revenue totals are therefore not a proxy
for economic health or sound fiscal policy, a distinction that will recur
throughout this analysis. Reconstructed historical estimates indicate that real
GDP in 1929 was roughly forty percent higher than in 1919.<a href="#_ftn14"

by a population increase of about seventeen million, real per-capita output
rose by approximately twenty-one percent over the same period. Because the 1919
GDP figure derives from a backward-extended historical series rather than
official BEA accounts, it should be treated as approximate. Still, the comparison
underscores that assessments of the decade must account for changes in
underlying economic capacity, not isolated movements in revenue. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Also
critical, from 1919 through 1924, an average of approximately 2.75 million more
tax units filed returns each year than after the Revenue Act of 1926 took
effect. This abrupt decline in participation was the principal factor behind
the disparate revenue levels across the period. That statute substantially
raised the personal exemption beginning in 1925, removing roughly 43 percent of
the 7.3 million tax units of 1924 from the tax rolls in subsequent years. As
marginal rates fell, both total and per-capita receipts accelerated through the
end of the decade. The data reveal that, following the Revenue Act of 1926, the
effective distribution of the income tax burden became markedly more
progressive, with lower-income groups largely removed from the rolls and
upper-income filers paying a rising share of total revenues.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Gene Smiley
and Richard Keehn’s reconstruction of 1920s income tax data has become a
standard reference for the period.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>15</span></a> Although the authors fully recognized
the exemption increases enacted in the early 1920s and incorporated those
changes into their revenue-share calculations, their tables of return counts
begin at the $3,000–$5,000 bracket. The original Statistics of Income for 1920
show more than 5.2 million filers with incomes between the exemption threshold
and $3,000, a group that disappears whenever the distribution is truncated at
$3,000. As a result, any presentation using that cutoff makes the early tax
base appear narrower than the raw Treasury bulletins reveal. For selected years
in the interwar period, returns reporting net income under $5,000 were
tabulated on a sampling basis in the Statistics of Income. The scale and
persistence of the shifts documented here, however, render estimation variance
immaterial to the structural conclusions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Notwithstanding
this caveat, the underlying data are sufficient on their own. The Statistics of
Income tables reproduced in Appendix B permit direct inspection of changes in
filing participation, reported incomes, and revenues across statutory regimes,
providing confirmation of the same patterns identified in reconstructed series.
The observed patterns are consistent with the behavioral response anticipated
by Mellon. The SOI tabulations likewise show substantial increases in net
income across the brackets most affected by the reforms. Taken together, these
movements demonstrate the strength of the behavioral response to the Mellon tax
program and are unambiguous when comparing the pre- and post-implementation
years surrounding the Revenue Act of 1926.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The most
pronounced increases occurred at the apex of the distribution, where the number
of filers expanded dramatically over the decade. Relative to the previous high
mark in 1916, the number reporting incomes above $1,000,000 rose by roughly 148
percent by the peak years of 1928–1929. Measured against the depressed levels
of the early 1920s, however, the expansion was far larger, with the number of
such filers increasing more than tenfold. The acceleration becomes evident
after 1924 and culminates in 1928 and 1929; compared with the pre-1925 average,
the average number of top-bracket filers in those peak years was roughly 524
percent higher.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A further
anomaly appears when reported high incomes (above $500,000) were greater in
1916 than in any year prior to 1925. Mellon, writing in </span><em><span
>Taxation: The People’s Business</span></em><span
> (1924), independently documented this
pattern using contemporaneous Treasury statistics. World War I and the
subsequent recession offer only a partial explanation, but they do not account
for the sustained weakness in the intervening years. In 1916, nominal gross
income for this cohort was more than three times the average from 1917 to 1924.
The tax environment accounts for the remaining divergence: the marginal rate in
1916 was only 12–15 percent for incomes above $500,000, whereas in the
following eight years it averaged 70 percent. Moreover, capital gains were not
distinguished from individual income until 1922, leaving realizations fully
exposed to the escalated rates. This disparity—and its consequences for
reported income—will be examined more fully later, as it is highly revealing. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The SOI
tables from the 1920s must be read in context to interpret developments in the
latter half of the decade. Viewed superficially, they can suggest that the
affluent simply grew richer while lower-income households fell behind. A quick
comparison of net income by bracket, combined with knowledge of the 1925 rate
reductions, can reinforce the impression that the tax schedule was designed to
favor high earners. But, as shown earlier, millions of low-income tax units
were removed from the tax rolls altogether. Their reported net incomes declined
accordingly not because their pretax incomes fell, but because expanded
exemptions eliminated their requirement to file. The apparent contraction in
the lower brackets is therefore a statistical artifact, not an economic
reversal.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In effect,
lower-income filers retained a larger share of their earnings and faced reduced
tax liabilities. With unemployment estimated to average roughly 3.5 percent
during the latter half of the decade, opportunities for gainful employment were
widespread.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>16</span></a> Table 5 illustrates the steep
reduction in the tax burden on incomes below $5,000 (about $70,000 in constant
2017 dollars). This group, which included many middle-income households, paid
only a negligible share of total income tax receipts. One might argue that this
cohort was not contributing its “fair share,” but this pattern was consistent
with the distribution Mellon and Coolidge intended: broad relief at the base
and a larger share of the burden borne by the highest earners.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >On the other
side of the income scale, returns filed by the most affluent—and the net
incomes reported—increased substantially. Among tax units with net incomes
above $100,000, nominal gains between 1924 and 1929 ranged from 87 to 253
percent. These movements are sometimes interpreted as evidence of widening
economic inequality. Yet IRS data record only reported income, a distinction
that becomes critical in the decades that follow. The marginal rate does not
determine how much pretax income individuals can earn; it shapes the manner in
which they report, realize, or conceal income. Economic output expands when the
incentives to produce outweigh the disincentives embedded in taxation or
regulation. When rates rise beyond certain thresholds, they alter reporting
behavior—prompting sheltering, shifting, deferral, or underreporting—thereby
affecting the income figures that appear in the data. This mechanism was well
understood prior to Mellon’s tenure. Treasury Secretaries </span><span
class=whitespace-normal><span >Carter
Glass</span></span><span > and </span><span
class=whitespace-normal><span >David
Franklin Houston</span></span><span >, as
well as President </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>Woodrow Wilson</span></span><span >,
each acknowledged that excessively high rates distorted reported income and
undermined revenue productivity through behavioral responses.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Economists
refer to this responsiveness as the elasticity of taxable income (ETI)—the
degree to which reported income changes when marginal tax rates shift. ETI is
most pronounced among top earners, whose resources and flexibility allow rapid
adjustment. Taxpayers may reduce effort, defer compensation, or reclassify income
through deductions, fringe benefits, and tax-exempt vehicles. Any change that
alters the after-tax reward to production introduces a wedge into economic decision-making:
some individuals work less, others simply report less. The pattern recurs
across episodes in the historical record—when top marginal rates rise sharply,
reported taxable income from this cohort tends to fall.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >It is also
important to note that these figures capture flows of reported income earned
within a given year rather than stocks of wealth or net assets. The personal
income tax reaches income, not accumulated capital, and its taxable base
depends on what individuals choose to realize and report. Accordingly, policies
that aim to use the income tax for wealth redistribution—or to impose
exceptionally elevated burdens on high-asset tax units—confront practical
limits. The evidence indicates that they frequently trigger changes in the
form, timing, and reporting of income, compromising the achievement of the
redistribution sought. As economist Alan Reynolds observed, “What is most
important is the marginal rate of all taxes on activities that would add to
income—such as working harder, investing time and money in a better education,
or saving and investing in a new business. When high marginal tax rates punish
added income, they must also punish added production. That slows economic
growth. When the economy grows slowly, tax receipts also grow slowly.” <a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>17</span></a>
</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Returning to
the data, the pronounced increase in income across all brackets above $5,000
following the Revenue Act of 1926 underscores the extent of taxpayers’
behavioral response to marginal tax rates. Millions of low- to mid-income
individuals were removed from the tax rolls entirely, and a larger share of the
nation’s tax burden was borne by upper-income earners, even as their marginal
rates declined. Taken together, these outcomes align closely with the effects
Secretary Mellon anticipated. The contemporaneous claim that the cuts relieved
high-income tax units at others’ expense was not borne out by the evidence; in
practice, the distribution of the tax burden shifted decisively in the opposite
direction.</span> <span >Table 6
illustrates this reallocation clearly. For context, $10,000 in the late 1920s
equates to roughly $140,000 in constant 2017 dollars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Even in real
terms, total revenue from incomes above $10,000 were higher in 1919, despite
157,000 fewer filers. Again, this reflects unusually high wartime profit
realizations taxed at the exceptionally high surtax rates of the Revenue Act of
1918. These receipts were the product of a temporary wartime income surge
rather than any durable revenue productivity of high rates, as the steep drop
in revenues after 1919 plainly demonstrates.</span> <span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>Once those temporary effects subsided, and the Mellon
reforms replaced the wartime schedule with a stable peacetime structure, the
tax base broadened and revenues normalized on a sustainable footing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >The stock
market boom in the latter half of the decade and the resulting surge in capital
gains at the top reflect the timing of wealth realization rather than the
creation of new wealth, underscoring the extent to which high-income tax bases
depend on asset turnover and expectations rather than stable income flows.
Total tax revenues rose, the share paid by the most affluent increased
substantially, and the national debt declined by nearly one-third.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">18</a></span>
 Taken together, the period registers as one of fiscal and economic expansion.
Policies that reduce marginal tax rates alter the returns to work and
investment, and historical data show corresponding adjustments in investment
behavior and reported income. Under these conditions, the Mellon tax reductions
coincided with broad improvements in living standards across the income
distribution.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The analysis
of the Mellon tax cuts is properly limited to 1929. Although the Revenue Act of
1926 remained in effect until 1932, observations beyond 1929 are not directly
comparable. The Smoot–Hawley Tariff of 1930, an abrupt and substantial change
in the tax burden on international commerce, and the onset of the Great
Depression introduced shocks that altered both economic conditions and taxpayer
behavior in ways unrelated to the late 1920s rate structure. These shifts make
it impossible to isolate the effects of the earlier reforms without conflating
them with events of a fundamentally different character. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As always,
multiple influences interacted throughout the decade, but the record indicates
that the tax reforms and stable monetary policy were a meaningful component of
the expansion that followed. Any alternative explanation must account for the
broad-based increases in output, income, and employment recorded during these
years. Whether competing hypotheses can fully explain the pattern is open to
interpretation; what is clear is that claims characterizing the tax reductions
as harmful are not supported by contemporaneous economic indicators.</span></p>

<h2 id="herbert-hoover-the-onset-of-the-great-depression-and-the-revenue-act-of-1932">Herbert Hoover, the Onset of the Great Depression, and the Revenue Act of 1932</h2>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With the
prosperity of the 1920s fading, the United States entered the most severe
downturn in its history. Some may be inclined to conflate the boom of the 1920s
with the calamity that followed, as though the Great Depression were its
inevitable consequence. The available evidence does not support that interpretation.
The Depression arose from a different constellation of shocks—monetary
contraction, collapsing credit, and global deflation following the trade
disruptions introduced by the Smoot–Hawley Tariff—along with substantial tax
increases enacted later at the federal, state, and local levels. Rapid gains in
output, employment, and real income characterized the close of the Mellon era;
what followed reflected a marked shift in policy and economic conditions rather
than a continuation of the prior decade.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This is not
the forum to dissect the full chain of events that produced and prolonged the
Depression, an undertaking that has filled volumes and lies beyond the scope of
this work. Nevertheless, a prevailing view among economic historians holds that
a combination of escalating trade barriers, contractionary monetary policy, and
fiscal missteps deepened the downturn after 1930. Acknowledging these limits
defines the boundaries of what this analysis seeks to explain. The Great
Depression is often said to have begun with the stock market crash of October
1929. In reality, that collapse, though dramatic, did not by itself cause the
catastrophe that followed. Unemployment averaged 3.2 percent in 1929, and
contemporary monthly labor indicators show no abrupt deterioration in the
months immediately following the crash.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>19</span></a>  Industrial employment
remained essentially stable through mid-1930, deviating only marginally from
1929 levels. By the spring of 1930, the economy was recovering, and stock
prices had regained much of their earlier decline.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
post-crash recovery ended abruptly in mid-1930, coinciding with the enactment
of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff on June 17—despite an open letter of warning signed
by over a thousand economists. The legislation contributed to escalating trade
tensions and retaliatory measures abroad at a moment when global demand was
already fragile. Monetary contraction and banking distress deepened over the
subsequent year, compounding the downturn. The inflection point is visible in
the labor data. Unemployment averaged 3.29 percent for the first six months of
1930, virtually identical to the annual rate of 1929. In the latter half of the
year, however, unemployment rose each month, culminating in an annual average
of 8.52 percent. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >What began
as a cyclical adjustment evolved into a pronounced contraction.</span> <span
>Labor market conditions deteriorated
steadily after mid-1930, and unemployment entered double digits the following
year before exceeding 20 percent in 1932. With revenues collapsing, the 72nd
Congress—Democratic in the House and narrowly Republican in the Senate—and
President Herbert Hoover responded with the Revenue Act of 1932, a sweeping set
of rate increases intended to restore budget balance. Hoover and Treasury
Secretary Ogden Mills, long adherents to fiscal orthodoxy, believed that
equilibrium in the federal accounts was essential to restoring confidence, even
as contractionary policies deepened the downturn.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In practice,
the resulting tax increases compressed the after-tax returns to work,
investment, and risk-taking, while simultaneously reducing disposable income. The
administration proceeded despite the evidence of the preceding decade: federal
revenues rise and fall with output and taxpayer behavior, not with statutory
rates in isolation. Fiscal legislation in the early 1930s reflected a continued
assumption of a direct relationship between elevated rates and higher
receipts—a premise the 1920s record had already undermined and that proved even
less tenable under far harsher economic conditions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In its
annual report, the Treasury described the Revenue Act of 1932 as follows:</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in'><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>[The Revenue Act of 1932] effected one
of the largest increases in taxes ever imposed by the Federal Government in
peace times. In a year in which the enactment of any new revenue measure
presented grave difficulties, the placing on the statute books of an act so
substantial in scope was an impressive achievement. Viewing the act in relation
to the emergency situation which made it necessary, there are a number of major
accomplishments which result from it, aside from the provision of substantial
additional revenue. These include the broadening of the base of the individual
income tax through reduction in personal exemptions; the limitation of
deductions from gross income on account of losses from sales of stocks and
bonds held for two years or less; the closing of loopholes in certain other
administrative provisions of the income tax law; and the inclusion among the
new taxes of certain taxes which are levied on a relatively broad base and will
yield relatively large amounts of revenue with little administrative cost.<a
href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>20</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Hoover signed
the Revenue Act on June 6, 1932, with its provisions applying retroactively to
the entire 1932 taxable year. Personal exemptions were reduced from $1,500 to
$1,000 for single filers and from $3,500 to $2,500 for married couples or heads
of family (see Table 7). The lowest rate rose from 1.5 percent to 4 percent,
and the top marginal rate increased from 25 percent to 63 percent. The act also
eliminated the earned-income credit, raised the corporate rate from 12 to 13.75
percent, increased the top estate tax, and added substantial new excises.
Although enacted in an effort to restore budget balance amid collapsing
receipts, these measures imposed significantly higher liabilities on households
and firms already under severe financial strain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With output
collapsing, Washington was not alone in raising taxes. State and local
governments, confronted with falling property values and fixed debt-service
obligations, enacted a wave of new and higher levies—including property, sales,
and income taxes. By 1932, combined state and local receipts were more than
twice federal revenues. The cumulative effect was substantial. At every level
of government, higher rates were imposed on a rapidly contracting income base,
narrowing the capacity to pay and diminishing the incentive to produce.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
experience of the preceding decades had repeatedly shown that elevated tax
rates can shrink the taxable base, particularly among high-income earners. In
1932, Congress and President Hoover repeated the pattern—this time as
unemployment reached historic levels during the worst phase of the Depression. Raising
rates at both ends of the income distribution compressed incentives to
production and disposable income across the economy at precisely the moment
when recovery may have been aided by the opposite. Yet because that same act
also lowered personal exemptions, the number of filers subject to tax
eventually expanded. It took several years, however, for the enlarged base to
compensate for the contraction in high-income reporting—a reminder that
governments can broaden the statutory reach of taxation even as the underlying
incentives that sustain production weaken.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By the time
the act took effect, the nation was already in deep economic downturn:
industrial output had fallen by nearly half, unemployment exceeded 20 percent,
and credit markets were paralyzed.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>21</span></a>  But instead of seeking relief through
lower tax burdens or measures aimed at restoring confidence, policy moved in
the opposite direction. More damaging than the federal tax hikes, the combined
federal, state, and local tax increases drove a widening wedge between pre-tax
returns and after-tax incentives for productive activity. As the data in the following
section will show, the results diverged sharply from the Treasury’s projections
of “substantial additional revenue.” Rather than stabilizing the fiscal
position or supporting recovery, the 1932 tax increases failed to reverse the
downturn and coincided with its continued deterioration. Table 7 traces the
evolution of the personal exemption, establishing how changes to a single
provision could widen or narrow the tax base depending on the policy
environment.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With the
United States deep in the throes of the Great Depression, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt entered office with the steep Revenue Act of 1932 rate schedule. Beginning
in 1934, he pursued additional measures aimed at increasing federal revenue
from upper-income tax units in advance of the broader revisions introduced in
the Revenue Act of 1935. Roosevelt outlined the principles in his June 1935
message to Congress that would become the standard by which his tax program
must be judged:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span >As
the fiscal year draws to its close it becomes our duty to consider the broad
question of tax methods and policies… these studies have made it very clear
that we need to simplify and clarify our revenue laws… If a government is to be
prudent its taxes must produce ample revenues without discouraging enterprise;
and if it is to be just it must distribute the burden of taxes equitably. I do
not believe that our present system… meets this test… Our revenue laws have
operated in many ways to the unfair advantage of the few… Because of the very
sound public policy of encouraging a wider distribution of wealth, I strongly
urge that the proceeds of this tax… be applied to the reduction of the national
debt.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>22</span></a> </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Roosevelt
framed higher, targeted taxation and debt retirement as the transmission
mechanism through which the policy would progressively lighten the tax burden
borne by the average taxpayer, while incidentally assisting in the restoration
of budget balance. The analysis that follows evaluates the extent to which the
ensuing legislation advanced those stated objectives. It is not evident from
contemporaneous fiscal data that such studies substantiated the president’s
assertions. The record of prior decades, if anything, pointed in the opposite
direction. Roosevelt’s appeal to lighten the tax burden on ordinary tax units
and balance the budget echoed earlier Treasury goals. Yet those aims had
already been realized under the Mellon program of the 1920s, which virtually
eliminated the income tax burden on the least affluent and aided in reducing
the national debt by roughly one-third. This section distinguishes three
channels through which tax policy shaped outcomes: (1) statutory base
expansion, (2) behavioral response at upper incomes, and (3) administrative
lock-in during wartime.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Economic conditions
of 1935 differed markedly from those of the prior decade, but the empirical
record remains clear; lower marginal rates had coincided with stronger growth
and steadier public finances. Therefore, Roosevelt’s call for reform must be
measured against the actual results of the tax changes that followed. The
Revenue Act of 1934 added several new liabilities on upper incomes, but the
individual income tax structure itself was not fundamentally revised until

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With the
Revenue Act of 1935 elevating top marginal rates, the Revenue Act of 1936
introduced an undistributed-profits tax on retained corporate earnings and
imposed additional taxes on corporate income. These actions came after earlier
increases in the effective capital gains tax rate—from 12.5 percent to 17.7
percent in 1934 and a further rise under the 1936 statute through additional
structural changes to the tax treatment of gains. Of critical importance, the
1936 law tied the capital gains rate to the holding period of assets. As Alan
Reynolds explained in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, “since the capital gains
tax rate grew in tandem with income tax rates, the top income tax bracket
increased to 79% in 1936, while the capital-gains tax rate jumped to 63% for
assets held one year, 47% after two years, 32% after five, and 24% after ten.
Even worse, the 1936 law added a surtax on ‘undistributed profits’—those not
paid out as dividends but kept to finance business investment.” <a

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The combined
effect of the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936 was a marked increase in the
effective tax burden on capital. Even when capital gains are measured on a
like-for-like basis—restricted to recognized long-term gains under
contemporaneous statutory definitions—the volume of gains reported to the
Treasury never fully recovered after the early 1930s. Average annual capital
gains declined from roughly $739 million in 1922–1933 to about $503 million in
1934–1944, a nominal reduction of approximately 32 percent.<a href="#_ftn24"
name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>24</span></a>
Notably, the earlier period includes the worst years of the Depression,
indicating that the subsequent shortfall cannot be attributed solely to
cyclical compression.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >From 1922
through 1933, long-term gains were taxed at a uniform 12.5 percent rate.
Beginning in 1934, gains were taxed through partial inclusion in ordinary
income, raising the implied statutory burden to roughly 19 percent (30 percent
inclusion taxed at a 63 percent top marginal rate). The introduction of
holding-period schedules and the undistributed profits tax increased the cost
of equity finance and reduced incentives for portfolio turnover. In an economy
already constrained by weak investment, the persistent decline in realizations
suggests more than temporary caution and is consistent with reduced risk-taking
and slower capital formation. The near-total collapse in realized gains between
1929 and 1932, followed by a decade of incomplete recovery despite partial
asset-price rebound, illustrates that the high-income tax base depends less on
the stock of wealth than on the incentives and conditions governing its
realization.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >After
passage of the Revenue Acts of 1935 and 1936, total personal income tax revenue

>Over the same period, real GDP rose
substantially—by roughly $137 billion in 1936 and an additional $61 billion in
1937—suggesting that part of the revenue expansion reflected broader income
growth rather than purely statutory change. In isolation, this pattern appeared
consistent with President Roosevelt’s stated objective of expanding federal
revenue. Yet the composition of the new revenue diverges sharply from the
stated aim of distributing the tax burden equitably. The increase also proved
short-lived: receipts declined over the following two years and were not
surpassed until 1940, when the number of filing tax units had roughly doubled
as exemption reductions and filing-rule changes broadened the lower end of the
tax base. Contextual figures underscore the point:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >While the

</span></span><span > Tax-code mechanics.
The sharply reduced personal exemptions under the Revenue Act of 1932 greatly
broadened the filing base, pulling large numbers of low- and moderate-income
households into the federal income tax system for the first time. These
reductions, enacted under President Hoover rather than Roosevelt, remained in
place throughout the New Deal with no restoration.</span></p>

Adjusted Service Bonds.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span

</span></span><span >Income shifting. The
undistributed profits tax encouraged the distribution of corporate earnings,
shifting income from the corporate to the individual tax base. Dividend
payments rose sharply in 1936 and 1937, providing direct evidence of this
shift. At the same time, heightened policy uncertainty and the prospect of
future tax changes likely contributed to a surge in capital-gains realizations,
which reached a 1930s peak of roughly $974 million in 1936.</span></p>

</span></span><span >Bracket creep. Annual
inflation of roughly 3.6 percent in 1937 raised nominal incomes within a
non-indexed tax schedule, modestly contributing at the margin to higher tax
liabilities even where real purchasing power changed little.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
combination of factors elevated both the number of returns and the revenues
drawn primarily from the lowest income groups. Although the economy had
recovered much of the ground lost earlier in the decade, the increase in
low-income tax receipts reflected administrative and statutory dynamics rather
than a surge in real prosperity. The results diverged from Roosevelt’s stated
aim of distributing the tax burden more equitably.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >On the
question of debt reduction, by the late 1930s federal debt had risen to levels
that Treasury officials themselves regarded as alarming, prompting growing
internal concern over continued peacetime borrowing and the long-run
implications for fiscal stability.</span> <span >New
Deal legislation accelerated government spending across a wide range of relief,
public works, and recovery programs. The individual initiatives varied in scope
and design, but their combined budgetary impact was substantial.</span> <span
>In May 1939, Treasury Secretary Henry
Morgenthau offered an unsparing assessment of the results before Congress:</span>
<span >“We have tried spending money. We
are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. … We
have never made good on our promises.&nbsp;...  After eight years of this
Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started—and an
enormous debt to boot.” <a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:#404040'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >From the
government’s perspective, the barometer for gauging tax policy is how much
revenue was collected. A more meaningful benchmark, however, is identifying the
rate structure that maximizes productive capacity—since revenues follow output,
not the reverse. Only when 1.3 million additional filers were added to the
rolls in1936 did real net income narrowly exceed the 1925-1929 average. Real
GDP per capita lagged as well, not surpassing its 1929 level until ten years
later. The pattern was similar for revenue; apparent gains followed the
downward extension of the tax base rather than a genuine economic recovery.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Because
statutory brackets and filing thresholds were fixed in nominal terms, taxpayer
participation and tax burden in this period must be assessed initially in
nominal dollars. Deflating the series does not materially alter the underlying
relationships. From 1925 through 1929, the Treasury collected a nominal annual
average of $893 million from roughly 4.1 million tax units. Between 1930 and
1940, total collections exceeded that pre-Depression benchmark only three
times: in 1936 ($1.21 billion from 5.4 million filers), in 1937 ($1.14 billion
from 6.3 million), and in 1940 ($1.44 billion from 14.6 million). Figure 1
illustrates the scale of fluctuation due to behavioral responses to the
incentives and constraints embedded in the tax code. It also bears recalling
that the filing population fluctuated substantially—by more than three million
tax units prior to 1925 and by an additional one to three and a half million
filers from 1936 forward—magnifying the apparent distributional changes
captured in the raw Statistics of Income, independent of cyclical variation.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Roosevelt
maintained that tax policy should raise sufficient revenue without discouraging
enterprise. Revenue did eventually rise substantially, but the more critical
question is whether this occurred at the expense of enterprise itself. By 1939,
Secretary Morgenthau would offer what was, by all indications, a painfully
candid appraisal of that shortcoming. His words summarized what the economic
data already showed; massive expenditures failed to produce durable employment
or growth. Morgenthau’s admission stands as one of the clearest internal
acknowledgements of the limits of New Deal stimulus, consistent with the
persistent weakness and volatility observed in private investment throughout
the late 1930s.</span> <span >Former
Federal Reserve Chairman </span><strong><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
font-weight:normal'>Arthur F. Burns</span></strong><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'> later drew a similar conclusion from an outside vantage
point, observing that the new taxes of the 1930s, imposed amid deep
unemployment, eroded confidence and reinforced the perception that the system
was punishing success rather than fostering recovery.<a href="#_ftn28"

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Unemployment
rose into the double digits in 1931, exceeded 20 percent from 1932 through
1935, and remained above 14 percent for the rest of the decade. Rates declined sharply
only with wartime mobilization, a boost driven by armament production rather
than any genuine revival in private sector activity. Moreover, although not all
sixteen million Americans who served in World War II would otherwise have been
in the civilian labor force, their induction materially reduced the civilian
labor-force denominator. This contraction mechanically lowered the measured
unemployment rate, masking the continued underlying weakness of the domestic
economy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
analysis does not attempt to adjudicate the macroeconomic impact of the New
Deal or the counterfactual question of whether additional spending might have
altered the business cycle. It instead evaluates the administration’s tax
program against its own stated objectives. On that narrower standard, the
record is clear: the policies adopted under Roosevelt produced neither a
durable expansion of the high-income tax base, nor an equitable distribution of
the tax burden, nor a reduction in the federal debt. On every count, the
empirical outcome ran in the opposite direction. Having identified the downward
shift in the tax burden, the corresponding developments among top-income filers
follow directly. Subsequent tables illustrate this divergence.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
selection of benchmark years for the following tables reflects clear structural
transitions in federal tax policy and economic conditions. 1929 represents the
final equilibrium of the Mellon reforms before Smoot–Hawley and the onset of
the Depression. The changes in 1932 and 1936 correspond to the Revenue Acts
enacted in those years, which redefined rates, exemptions, and the filing
population.<a name="OLE_LINK3"> 1940 captures the mature New Deal tax structure
as modified by the Revenue Act of 1940, enacted in anticipation of large-scale
defense spending, just before full wartime mobilization altered both incomes
and compliance patterns. The Revenue Act of 1942 marks the largest expansion of
the tax base in U.S. history, while 1946 provides the first stable postwar year
following the distortions of 1941–1945. The series concludes in 1950, a natural
endpoint at mid-century. </a>These dynamics are reflected in the distributional
patterns summarized in Table 9.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Evidently,
the number of tax units reporting incomes above $100,000 declined rapidly, and
their share of total revenues was nearly halved by 1932. The partial rebound in
1936 reflects temporary reclassification effects rather than a durable recovery
of the high-income tax base. Even as aggregate income and output recovered
through 1950, the top-income share of total tax receipts never again approached
its pre-Depression level. The apparent post-Depression “equalization” of income
most plausibly reflects contraction and avoidance, not genuine redistribution. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The fiscal
patterns of 1941–1945 reflect wartime mobilization rather than normal peacetime
dynamics and must be interpreted as such. But these years do not alter the
underlying trend. By the time the United States entered the war, the tax base
had already expanded dramatically downward, and reported income at the top had
already contracted. Comparable top-end disparities appeared even when measured
against the First World War era. By 1936, the number of high-income filers had
fallen far below 1916 levels despite much higher national output, underscoring
the sensitivity of reported income to tax policy. In 1916, there were roughly
29 percent more tax units reporting incomes above $100,000 than in 1936, and
their combined net income was about 91 percent greater in nominal terms. Over
the same period, nominal GDP rose by roughly 69 percent and real GDP by about
51 percent. Such figures are difficult to reconcile with diminished productive
capacity alone and are more consistent with distortionary effects of the
intervening rise in marginal rates and the migration of income into sheltered
or deferred forms. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These episodes
were not confined to the Depression decade. The number of returns reporting
incomes over $100,000 did not exceed its 1928 level again until 1948—the same
year in which both net income and revenue for this group rebounded substantially.
The timing was not coincidental. The Revenue Act of 1948 included the
income-splitting provisions that altered marginal incentives on a permanent
basis for married tax units. By effectively doubling surtax bracket widths,
income splitting reduced the marginal cost of reporting additional income,
particularly at the upper end of the distribution.<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>29</span></a>
Consistent with this incentive structure, the post-1948 period shows a marked
increase in high-income married filers relative to singles, suggesting that
income splitting contributed to higher reported incomes beyond the transitory
effects of temporary credits. Although inflation was elevated in 1948, the
magnitude and concentration of the increase in top-income filings far exceeded
what nominal price changes alone could plausibly account for, pointing instead
to the discrete incentive effects of income splitting. Moreover, inflation was
substantially higher in 1947, yet no comparable increase in top-income filings
or reported income occurred. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The greater
effect was to modestly reintroduce some marginal incentives that had been
largely suppressed since the early 1930s, after the Revenue Act of 1932
displaced the incentive structure established under the Mellon reforms of 1926.
These gains were reinforced, though not initiated, by postwar adjustments—most
notably the Revenue Act of 1945—that unwound the extraordinary fiscal measures
of World War II. The repeal of emergency levies, the expiration of temporary
excises, and the removal of wartime controls eased effective tax burdens as the
economy returned to peacetime conditions. Much of this relief was mechanical
rather than programmatic, but it nonetheless produced a lighter statutory
landscape heading into 1948.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Additional
relief arrived at the end of the decade. Despite statutory top rates of 91
percent in 1947–1949, tax units did not generally face those liabilities.
Congress enacted temporary postwar tax-reduction credits that applied after
liability was calculated under the regular schedule. The Revenue Act of 1948
granted a 5 percent credit against individual liabilities, reducing the
effective top marginal rate to roughly 86.45 percent. The Revenue Act of 1949
provided a 9.75 percent reduction for tax on income above $100,000, lowering
the effective top rate to about 82.13 percent. Although these credits were
temporary, they materially altered marginal incentives and, in combination with
income splitting, produced the strongest resurgence in reported high-income
earnings since the Mellon years. The subsequent graphs (Figure 2 and Figure 3) make
this pattern unambiguous.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >If these
figures seem difficult to reconcile with a larger economy, the proximate cause
is not obscure. Marginal rates on incomes above $100,000 ranged from 7 to 15
percent in 1916, peaked at 25 percent during 1925–1931, and rose to between 62
and 79 percent by 1936. Changes of this magnitude predictably shaped taxpayer
behavior and align with well-established evidence of high elasticity of taxable
income at upper brackets. More pointedly, the rate structure reduced the
after-tax return to additional enterprise and investment at the margin,
contributing to weaker output and a slower recovery in the upper tax base. The
steep 1930s decline in high-income filers and their reported income is most
plausibly explained by avoidance, deferral, and shifting—rather than by any
sudden disappearance of underlying productive capacity. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The anomaly
is striking. In 1929, the cohort earning more than $100,000 included about
5,600 fewer tax units than in 1950. Yet in real terms, the smaller 1929 contingent
still reported approximately $21 billion more in total net income than the 1950
group’s adjusted gross income. This divergence becomes more dramatic when
viewed against macroeconomic conditions. By 1950, real GDP was more than twice
as large as in 1929. Across the entire 1925–1929 period—the full stretch of comparable
years following the Revenue Act of 1926—average aggregate income among tax units
reporting above $100,000 was not matched again until 1948 in nominal terms, and
in real terms not at any point through 1960. The evidence, therefore, cannot be
attributed to a single anomalous year. Such a trend is difficult to interpret
as an actual contraction in the nation’s ability to generate high-income
output. In an economy whose prosperity is measured by the production of goods,
services, and capital formation, this would imply regression rather than progress.
Figure 2 illustrates these data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Roosevelt’s
message to Congress came three days after a letter from Secretary Morgenthau
detailing the increasingly elaborate methods by which citizens were sheltering
income from taxation. The episode underscores what the filing data repeatedly
show: when rates rise to punitive levels, taxpayers adjust their behavior
accordingly. During these years, high statutory rates coincided with shifts
into shelters, deferral strategies, and the underreporting or non-reporting of
income, all of which reduced the amount of income appearing on returns. The
consequence was not only diminished top-end revenue but a visible misallocation
of resources, as capital and effort moved away from productive activity and
toward legally minimizing liability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Across
multiple administrations, Treasury secretaries and presidents acknowledged the same
basic principle: that sufficiently high marginal tax rates induce avoidance and
suppress reported income. Yet a common interpretation in the economic history
literature depicts the early 1940s through the 1970s as a model era of equality
attributed to redistributive fiscal policy. It is often conceded that avoidance
occurred but assumed that, even allowing for such behavior, the reported tax
data still approximate the underlying income distribution. That assumption is dubious.
Reported incomes and corporate profits can be measured, but no statistic can
capture the income the tax authority never sees—offshore holdings, deferred
capital gains, and other legal or illicit shelters. More fundamentally, these
data describe </span><em><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
font-style:normal'>pretax</span></em><span >
income. High marginal rates can narrow inequality only after tax; if they
instead reduce pretax earnings by lowering the after-tax return to labor
effort, saving, or investment, they redistribute not wealth but output itself. While
later distributional national accounts allocate broader components of national
income, behavioral responsiveness in taxable pretax income remains central to
interpreting long-run inequality measures.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The same caution
applies even more strongly to estimates of wealth. Income can be estimated only
with difficulty; wealth is even less tractable, as decades of debate in the
economic literature demonstrate. Modern wealth series—whether derived from
estate multipliers, capitalization of income flows, or reconstructed balance
sheets—ultimately rest on the same income data and therefore inherit their
behavioral distortions. Under such conditions, the claim that confiscatory tax
rates reduced wealth concentration is empirically fragile; when reported top
incomes collapse, inferred wealth shares must decline automatically.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
following data points illustrate why such caution is necessary. The record
shows that the number of returns reported by tax units earning over $500,000
failed to exceed their 1929 level for thirty-five years. In constant 2017
dollars, that threshold equaled about $7.1 million in 1929 but only $4 million
in 1964—a substantially lower real benchmark reached by fewer tax units more
than three decades later. This despite real GDP more than three times greater in
1964 than in 1929. Equally striking, the 1929 real net income for this cohort
was not surpassed until 1968.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >More
revealing still, aside from the brief interval of 1925–1929, the number of
returns in this bracket never again reached its 1916 total until 1950. For
context, $500,000 represented roughly $11.2 million in 1916 and just over $5
million in 1950. The pattern is even starker when examining real reported
income for this cohort, which did not exceed its 1916 level until 1965. Outside
the late twenties, there is not a single year between 1917 and 1964 in which
real top-end income returned to its pre-World War I scale, despite an economy
that was vastly larger. By 1965, the number of top filers was 3.5 times higher
than in 1916, and real GDP was more than five times greater.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Such
patterns strain the interpretation that high-income opportunities had
materially contracted at a time when the economy was expanding at historic
scale. Only after the Revenue Act of 1964 reduced the top rate to 70 percent
did the number of high-income returns, and their aggregate reported income, begin
to recover. The evidence speaks plainly; the apparent disappearance of
high-income tax units was less an economic reality than a statistical artifact
of the prevailing rate structure. What disappeared was reported income, not
underlying economic activity or wealth—at least not on the scale the tax data
would imply. The accompanying graph in Figure 3 illustrates this divergence. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
figures reveal a clear M–W inversion: top marginal tax rates trace an M over
time, while reported high-income output responds inversely in a W. The turning
points align with statutory changes rather than with secular economic trends.
Because 1916 income data are reported on a gross-income basis, whereas 1917
onward uses net income after allocated deductions, slight definitional
differences may affect strict comparability at threshold margins; however, the
magnitude of the inversion observed in Figures 2 and 3 is not driven by this
reporting distinction. The retreat of high-income filers is evident in the data
and conflicts with the redistributive aims articulated in 1935. What emerged
was not a redistribution of wealth from rich to poor, but a redistribution of
tax liability onto those least able to bear it. These comparative data reveal
the magnitude of the shift:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• Tax units
reporting under $3,000 of income averaged 1.9 million from 1925 to 1929.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >• By 1942,
that number had reached 31.8 million—an increase of more than sixteen-fold.<br>
• Between 1936 and 1942, the under $3,000 group expanded by 28.1 million
filers, and their tax payments rose by more than $2.8 billion—over one hundred
times their earlier level.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>31</span></a><br>
• From 1936 to 1942, roughly 30.5 million additional tax units with incomes
below $5,000 entered the system.<br>
• Their share of the total tax burden rose from 5 percent to 48 percent.<br>
• During the same period, the over $100,000 group’s share of revenues fell from
40 percent to 9 percent.<br>
• Their share of total net income declined from 5 percent to 1 percent.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Roosevelt’s
presidency (1933–1945) spanned this entire realignment, though using 1933 as
the base year and auditing through 1945 would magnify the contrasts still
further. The year 1936 is used here because it marked the first full year under
the individual income tax code of the Revenue Act of 1935. It is true, of
course, that wartime mobilization demanded unprecedented revenue and required a
broader tax base. Yet the groundwork for that expansion had been laid years
before the war began. Under President Hoover’s Revenue Act of 1932, the
personal exemption fell to $1,000 for single filers and $2,500 for married
couples—substantially increasing liabilities for many moderate earners even
before the Depression had run its course. By the time the first major wartime
tax bill was passed in 1940, the base of taxable income had already expanded
far beyond its late-1920s limits. Legislators had seven years to lighten the
burden on lower-income households before war financing rendered such relief
impracticable, yet no such relief was enacted. On the contrary, the personal
exemption was reduced twice before the U.S. was officially engaged in the war
and two additional times during Roosevelt’s tenure (see Table 7).</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Current
Tax Payment Act of 1943 completed this transformation by introducing
withholding at the source, taxing wages and salaries directly as they were
earned. What began as an emergency wartime measure soon became a permanent
feature of federal finance. The mass-income tax created by measures enacted between
1932 and 1944 redefined the fiscal structure of the United States. Exemption
thresholds never returned to their prewar real values, and the share of
Americans subject to income tax remained permanently higher. The wartime
rationale faded, but the policy endured. The downward shift of the tax burden
toward lower- and middle-income groups was not a temporary expedient—it was
institutionalized inertia.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
outcomes ran directly counter to Roosevelt’s stated objectives for tax policy.
The large increase in tax units earning under $5,000 did not coincide with full
labor-market recovery but occurred during a decade marked by persistent
unemployment and uneven income growth. Unemployment remained in the double
digits throughout the 1930s—reaching nearly 25 percent at its height—whereas
rates had averaged about 5 percent during the 1920s (roughly 3.5 percent from
1925–1929). Under these conditions, the downward expansion of the tax base
appears to reflect statutory changes more than a broad-based surge in real
earnings. Between 1929 and 1950, the burden of federal taxation inverted; Table
10 details this reversal.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The analysis
of the FDR era necessarily spans the extraordinary fiscal and economic
conditions of World War II. Unlike the interruption posed by the Depression and
Smoot–Hawley in the early 1930s—events that overwhelm any attempt to isolate
the incentive structure of the Mellon-era tax system despite statutory
continuity—the wartime years can be examined on their own terms, because the
tax system was deliberately scaled to finance mobilization rather than rendered
observationally opaque by an uncontrolled breakdown. This examination therefore
traces how the tax system functioned under those radically different fiscal
demands and how taxpayer participation and reported income responded to
statutory changes once the emergency receded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >While millions
of new low-income households entered the filing base, it bears noting that
throughout the 1930s, federal excise taxes—not the individual income tax—were
the government’s principal source of revenue. In every year from 1934 through
1942, excise receipts exceeded income tax collections, and in several years by
more than a two-to-one margin. Because these levies were embedded in the prices
of widely purchased goods—fuel, tobacco, telephone service, transportation—they
fell most heavily on those with the least discretionary income. In practice,
the revenue system of the 1930s shifted the tax burden decisively downward and
did so long before wartime mobilization expanded the income tax into a mass
obligation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >A revenue
system so heavily reliant on regressive consumption taxes operated alongside a
monetary environment undergoing its own upheaval. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt
issued Executive Order 6102, requiring the surrender of most privately held
monetary gold and suspending domestic gold convertibility, with limited
exemptions. The following year’s Gold Reserve Act raised the official gold
price from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, devaluing the dollar by roughly 41 percent.
The consequences were immediate and far-reaching; holders of public and private
debt saw the real value of their claims eroded, while debtors—including the
federal government—found their obligations effectively reduced.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >British
economist John Maynard Keynes criticized Roosevelt’s monetary strategy, arguing
that the administration’s suspension of domestic gold convertibility and its
erratic revaluation policies created uncertainty that undermined confidence and
delayed recovery. In an open letter to the </span><em><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>New York Times</span></em><span >
in December 1933, he wrote: “In the field of gold devaluation and exchange
policy, the time has come when uncertainty should be ended. This game of blind
man’s bluff with exchange speculators serves no useful purpose and is extremely
undignified. It upsets confidence, hinders business decisions, occupies the
public attention in a measure far exceeding its real importance, and is
responsible both for the irritation and for a certain lack of respect which
exists abroad.” <a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>32</span></a> Though many forces contributed to the
Depression’s persistence, fiscal and monetary policy choices—however
constrained by contemporary circumstances—remain subject to analytical
scrutiny. The devaluation of the dollar relative to gold is often treated as a
step toward monetary stabilization, but it came after several years of severe
deflation and was accompanied by continuing policy uncertainty, limiting its
capacity to reverse the Depression’s accumulated damage.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Fiscal
measures enacted during World War II belong to a different category. Although
the United States did not enter the conflict until after Pearl Harbor in
December 1941, it was already supporting the Allied effort through the
Lend-Lease program, proposed in 1940 and enacted in March 1941. Given the
stakes, extraordinary taxation and borrowing were unavoidable. In that context,
the fiscal measures adopted during wartime reflect fundamentally different objectives
and constraints. The issue is that the war ended in 1945, yet the fiscal
structure established during the emergency persisted long afterward. This
discussion is not intended to suggest that taxation alone caused or prolonged
the Great Depression; rather, it isolates the measurable effects of fiscal
policy within a broader set of economic dynamics. Many forces converged, and
hindsight simplifies what contemporaries faced amid uncertainty. The purpose
here is not to evaluate the wider New Deal program or Roosevelt’s leadership,
but to identify how specific statutory changes in the tax system affected
participation, reported income, and revenues. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The record
leaves little ambiguity about what policymakers said, what they enacted, and
what the data reveal. The combined tax policies of Hoover and Roosevelt placed
a disproportionate burden on lower-income households while diminishing the
relative income tax contribution of those at the top. The paradox that emerges
from this period is straightforward: the expansion of public responsibilities
did not translate into a greater capacity to tax upper-income filers. Confiscatory
top marginal rates reduced the effective base by encouraging avoidance and
reclassification, limiting the revenue obtainable from high-income tax units
even as national output recovered and expanded. In practice, behavioral
responses—not statutory intentions—determined the system’s yield, a reality
often overlooked in retrospective assessments of mid-century taxation.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >What began
as an effort to restore confidence and recovery evolved into wartime
exigency—and ultimately into a permanent mass-tax system. The personal
exemption for married couples would not exceed its 1932–1939 nominal level
until 1987, and even that increase left it below the amounts allowed from 1913
to 1916. In nominal terms, the married-couple exemption did not match its
pre–World War I value until 1989, and the single-filer exemption would not
reach its 1913–1916 level until 2002. Adjusted for inflation, the real value of
the personal exemption had become almost negligible by the mid-1980s, when it
stood at $3,800 for married couples and $1,900 for single filers—only a small
fraction of its prewar purchasing power.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>33</span></a> The standard deduction,
introduced in 1944 and capped at $1,000, offered little relief. Taken together,
these figures show how readily emergency measures can solidify into enduring
features of the tax code, resistant to reversal once institutionalized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >This tendency
was recognized by eventual Nobel Laureate economist Paul Samuelson, who
observed in 1948 that “Each period of emergency—each war, each
depression—expands the activity of government. After each emergency has passed,
expenditures never seem to go back to their previous levels.” <a href="#_ftn34"
name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>34</span></a> The
pattern was evident as early as 1916–1925; even after the Revenue Act of 1926,
rates remained several times higher than before World War I. The pronounced
rate increases imposed during the Great Depression carried forward into the
wartime tax regime, and the persistence of that structure thereafter
exemplified the ratchet effect in fiscal policy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Top marginal
rates reached 94 percent in 1944 and—aside from the temporary postwar credits
that reduced effective burdens in 1947–1949—remained in the low 90s until the
Revenue Act of 1964. Throughout this period, the lowest statutory rate never
fell below 20 percent. Such a structure sharply altered marginal incentives, even
as aggregate capital deepening proceeded under the exceptional conditions of
the postwar period. At these levels, statutory rates nonetheless discouraged
incremental risk-taking and distorted the allocation of capital at the margin. By
mid-century, high-income individuals and business owners had nearly two decades
of experience minimizing exposure to elevated personal rates. With corporate
rates roughly fifty points below the top individual schedule, shifting income
toward the corporate base became the economically rational response wherever
feasible, reducing effective personal tax burdens without altering statutory
rates. Compensation practices evolved in parallel, with a growing share
delivered through perks, deferred pay, and other non-taxable forms.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Nevertheless,
the period commonly described as the “golden years,” from 1947 to 1973, did
exhibit the strongest average growth by many conventional metrics. The
inference that fiscal policy must therefore have been approximating optimality,
because it was not misaligned enough to prevent this outcome, does not follow. The
postwar expansion is frequently interpreted as evidence that the prevailing tax
regime did not impede growth and that its high marginal rates contributed
materially to the era’s more equal income distribution. A more precise
interpretation is that extraordinary underlying conditions—postwar
normalization, demographic tailwinds, suppressed global competition, and
pent-up demand—were sufficiently powerful to generate strong outcomes even in
the presence of significant policy constraints.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A closer
analogy is an elite athlete performing exceptionally under unusually favorable
conditions while using equipment later understood to be suboptimal. Strong
performance demonstrates resilience and talent, not that the constraint
enhanced performance. Once those extraordinary conditions receded, slower
growth does not retroactively validate the earlier constraint; it reflects an
economy approaching its frontier rather than evidence that the prior policy
configuration was optimal.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As for the
perception of greater parity in incomes, the cumulative effect was that
official income data likely understated the true concentration of earnings.
Measured solely through reported pretax incomes, inequality appeared to narrow,
but much of this compression was statistical rather than substantive.
Throughout the period, tax policy and economic behavior diverged; structures
intended to promote equity encouraged avoidance and shifted income out of the
individual tax base. The result was a prolonged stagnation in reported
upper-income earnings that reflected reporting incentives rather than
underlying economic reality—a distortion that persisted until postwar rate
reductions altered the incentives governing how income was earned, realized, and
disclosed. Reported income understates both concealed earnings and foregone
production; the data cannot distinguish between them, but either mechanism complicates
simplistic redistributive claims.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >What emerges
from this record is not a period-specific aberration, but a recurring fiscal
mechanism. When marginal tax rates rise beyond levels compatible with
incentivizing sustained production and accurate reporting, the income tax can cease
to scale proportionally with economic growth. Output may expand, employment may
rise, and aggregate receipts may increase—particularly under conditions of strong
postwar growth and capital deepening—yet the upper end of the tax base becomes
progressively hollowed out. Apparent equalization follows, not because incomes
converge upward or wealth is redistributed downward, but because reported
high-income activity contracts. The result is a tax system that appears more
progressive while becoming less effective, less transparent, and less capable
of financing its own ambitions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
mechanism is most clearly illustrated by the M–W inversion (Figures 2 and 3),
which makes the underlying relationship explicit. A fivefold increase in real
GDP alongside near-stagnant top-bracket income is difficult to reconcile without
one of two conditions: either (1) a genuine collapse in high-income
productivity or (2) a collapse in reported income driven by tax-induced
behavioral responses. The broader economic record offers scant evidence for the
first; the post-1932 tax regime made the second predictable.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >John F.
Kennedy’s role in the development of federal tax reduction is less frequently
emphasized than other aspects of his presidency. His fiscal program faced
substantial resistance during his lifetime, particularly within his own party.
The Revenue Act of 1964 was enacted on February 26, 1964, after Kennedy’s
assassination, but the plan was fundamentally his; President Lyndon B. Johnson
and Congress advanced the proposal largely as Kennedy had framed it. Emerging
from a Democratic Congress, the legislation passed with broad bipartisan
support on a final conference adoption (House 326–83; Senate 74–19), reflecting
a policy consensus that lower marginal rates would strengthen incentives to
produce, invest, and report income.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>36</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >At the
beginning of Kennedy’s administration, the economic setting bore a partial
resemblance to the early 1920s: high marginal rates persisted in peacetime,
avoidance incentives were entrenched, and policymakers sought to restore
stronger private investment and hiring. Kennedy, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas
Dillon, and their economic advisers recognized many of the same structural
distortions identified by earlier tax reformers—punitive rates, investment
drag, and a tax code that rewarded avoidance over productivity.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy had
campaigned on a promise to “get America moving again,” and to that end, a
succession of revenue acts was designed to reverse course. The Revenue Act of
1962 and the Revenue Act of 1964 were not conceived as temporary measures but
as long-term reforms aimed at restoring sustained economic expansion. The 1962
Act initiated the process by allowing faster depreciation schedules and
providing incentives for business investment. The comprehensive 1964 Act advanced
the program, instituting across-the-board rate reductions and modernizing key
elements of the tax code. These reforms were followed by a renewed expansion of
private investment and consumer activity.</span> <span >In
the years that followed, unemployment declined to its lowest level in a decade,
business confidence strengthened, and the economy experienced a sustained
period of prosperity—one that persisted until later shifts in fiscal and
monetary policy in the opposite direction.</span> </p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As always,
multiple forces were at work, and no single policy can be isolated as the sole
cause of the ensuing expansion. Yet it is appropriate to recognize that the tax
cuts formed a central component of a deliberate policy environment conducive to
growth. Fiscal and monetary conditions operated in tandem—sound monetary policy
alongside rate reductions—to reinforce stability and investment. This
interaction was later articulated by Robert Mundell, who observed: “The correct
policy mix is based on fiscal ease to get more production out of the economy,
in combination with monetary restraint to stop inflation. The increased
momentum of the economy provided by the stimulus of a tax cut will cause a
sufficient demand for credit to permit real monetary expansion at higher
interest rates.” <a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The fiscal
half of the policy mix has been identified; on the monetary side, Kennedy adhered
closely to Secretary Dillon’s insistence on maintaining a strong dollar. Early
reliance on Operation Twist, an effort to stimulate growth through yield-curve
manipulation while simultaneously defending the balance of payments, proved
limited and did not become a sustained operating framework. Monetary policy
returned to a conventional emphasis on price stability, external balance, and
dollar credibility. </span><strong><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;

restoration of a disciplined, strong-dollar monetary stance established a

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Revenue
Act of 1964 marked the first major statutory reduction in marginal tax rates

included a phased implementation—partial in 1964, with the full effect realized
in 1965. A parallel goal was reform: closing loopholes and reducing distortions

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The peak
corporate income tax rate was also reduced from 52 to 48 percent. In both
magnitude and breadth, the package was one of the more extensive general tax
reductions enacted up to that time, with the largest nominal cuts accruing to
upper-income tax units under the progressive rate schedule. Neither Kennedy nor
Johnson faced accusations of enacting “tax cuts for the rich,” and the program
was not framed as “trickle-down” economics. Both contemporary discussion and
later historical assessments treated the reform as a standard, growth-oriented
adjustment rather than as an ideological tax-cutting agenda. This is notable
given the scale of the reform; the top marginal individual rate was reduced by
21 percentage points, matching the magnitude of the Revenue Act of 1926
reduction and exceeding the initial reduction enacted under the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A common
explanation is that the Kennedy tax cuts were presented as “Keynesian,” meaning
a demand-side fiscal stimulus aimed at raising aggregate spending. “Keynesian”
here refers to the doctrines of John Maynard Keynes, whose framework dominated
mid-twentieth-century macroeconomics and was widely associated with
demand-driven growth. Yet Kennedy’s own justification—repeated in his messages
to Congress—did not fit neatly within that category. He anticipated that lower
rates would expand output, reduce unemployment, and eventually yield higher
revenues through stronger real growth. The underlying logic echoed a
long-standing view that marginal rate reductions can encourage productive
activity, a line of reasoning articulated by classical economists and reflected
in Mellon’s 1920s arguments.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Determining
which, if any, elements of the demand-side prescription applied to the Revenue
Act of 1964 requires examining both the policy’s stated intentions and the
historical record. It is therefore useful to consider what Keynes himself had
written about tax policy. Writing in 1933, Keynes observed, “Nor should the
argument seem strange that taxation may be so high as to defeat its object, and
that, given sufficient time to gather the fruits, a reduction of taxation will
run a better chance, than an increase, of balancing the Budget.” <a
href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>38</span></a><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>  </span>The statement closely parallels the
arguments advanced in the early 1920s and, notably, makes no reference to
deficit spending or public outlays as the primary means of stimulating demand.
Additional remarks from Keynes on taxation will be addressed in the following
analysis.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy’s
Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) was composed of leading Keynesians,
including Chairman Walter Heller, James Tobin, and Kermit Gordon. Another
prominent voice, though holding no official post, was Paul Samuelson, whose
views exerted influence on the administration’s initial economic thinking. By
the early 1960s, Keynesian analysis had become the dominant framework in
American macroeconomics, and the period was frequently characterized as the
“Keynesian Revolution.” They were widely described as architects of the “New
Economics,” a program informed by postwar Keynesian theory as synthesized by
economists such as</span><span class=whitespace-normal><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'> Samuelson</span></span><span >
and rooted more broadly in the ideas introduced by Keynes in <i>The General
Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</i> (1936).</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As noted,
the first major step toward tax reform was the Revenue Act of 1962, which
targeted business investment. The act accelerated depreciation schedules,
introduced a 7-percent investment tax credit, and allowed firms to deduct a
larger share of capital expenditures more rapidly from taxable income. These
measures were designed to encourage modernization and capital formation and
thus began the process of restoring investment incentives that the Revenue Act
of 1964 would advance two years later.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >During the
first year of Kennedy’s presidency, the spending initiatives advanced by the
Council of Economic Advisers represented the most readily available policy
options. At the same time, Kennedy directed the Treasury Department to begin
developing a comprehensive program of tax reform, fully aware that such a
measure would face greater political resistance. Yet as the expansion
progressed and concerns persisted about the strength of private investment,
Kennedy’s focus shifted toward a broad-based tax reduction aimed at reviving
productivity and long-term growth. Kennedy consulted widely within his
administration, but there was a clear hierarchy of influence. As historian
James N. Giglio later observed,<span class=QuoteChar> </span>“It was obvious
that Keynesian economists such as [John Kenneth] Galbraith, who opted for more
public expenditures, or [Walter] Heller, who favored a general tax cut, had
limited influence on Kennedy during this period. Kennedy listened more to
Dillon, the Republican secretary of the treasury, who had close ties with the
financial community.” </span><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>39</span></a> </p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In the
decades since, some interpretations have emphasized the Keynesian framing of
the 1964 tax cuts or attributed the proposal primarily to the Council of
Economic Advisers. These views, while common, understate Kennedy’s own
reasoning and the documented role of Treasury Secretary Dillon. Although the
CEA referenced the plan using Keynesian terminology of the period, Kennedy’s
public statements were more closely aligned with incentive-based reasoning than
with demand-side stimulus. This distinction is reflected in a December 20,
1962, memorandum from Walter Heller to the president, included in his “Brief
Book on Economic Matters.” The memorandum takes the Treasury’s tax proposal as
given and supplies a macroeconomic justification rather than claiming authorship
of the program.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Two years after
passage, Heller claimed that “the rationale of the 1964 tax-cut proposal came
straight out of the country’s post-war economic textbooks.” <a href="#_ftn40"
name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>40</span></a> While
he did not cite a specific volume, the reference presumably evokes the
Keynesian stabilization framework typified by Paul Samuelson’s <i>Economics</i>
(1948), the dominant macroeconomics text of the era. The rationale Kennedy
publicly advanced—lower marginal rates to encourage work, saving, and
investment—was hardly novel. Treasury officials and presidents between 1918 and
1925 had made analogous arguments, drawing on an older classical tradition
running from Hume and Smith to Jean-Baptiste Say. Nonetheless, later accounts
often describe the Kennedy program as Keynesian. The contemporaneous record is
more revealing: the speeches, official messages, and legislative sequence
establish the program’s rationale and custody as it moved from proposal to
enactment.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In 1961,
President Kennedy directly identified his instruction to the Secretary of the
Treasury to research and prepare a comprehensive tax reform program. This
effort built on earlier congressional studies of tax reform during the
mid-1950s and, more specifically, on reviews undertaken by the House Committee
on Ways and Means in the late 1950s. After extended deliberation, the Committee
had recommended an across-the-board rate reduction of roughly 30 percent,
though no formal bill was introduced. Before joining the Kennedy administration
in 1961 as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, Stanley S.
Surrey had participated in a task force that developed detailed recommendations
for tax reduction. In Kennedy’s 1961 address to Congress, he referred to the Secretary
of Treasury, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Joint Economic Committee
but made no mention of Heller, Samuelson, or the Council of Economic Advisers.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy
stated:</span></p>

>While it is essential that the Congress
receive at this time this Administration's proposals for urgent and obvious tax
adjustments needed to fulfill the aims listed above, time has not permitted the
comprehensive review necessary for a tax structure which is so complicated and
so critically important to so many people. This message is but a first though
urgent step along the road to constructive reform.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span >I am
directing the Secretary of the Treasury, building on recent tax studies of the
Congress, to undertake the research and preparation of a comprehensive tax
reform program to be placed before the next session of the Congress.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>Progressing from these studies,
particularly those of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Joint Economic
Committee, the program should be aimed at providing a broader and more uniform
tax base, together with an appropriate rate structure. We can thereby work
toward the goal of a higher rate of economic growth, a more equitable tax
structure, and a simpler tax law. I know these objectives are shared by—and, at
this particular time of year, acutely desired by—the vast majority of the
American people.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >In addition to
Kennedy’s 1961 address, no source is more definitive on the origins of the tax
program than Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon, who confronted the question
directly in two oral-history interviews recorded shortly after the
legislation’s enactment. His testimony is unequivocal; the tax program was
conceived, structured, and drafted within the Treasury Department, and the
Council of Economic Advisers entered the process only at the final review
stage. Importantly, these interviews were conducted before the
effects—favorable or otherwise—of the tax cuts had materialized, leaving little
incentive for retrospective reinterpretation.</span></p>

Of course, there is no truth in that at all. This was something that was
originally discussed by me with the President before my appointment. It was
part of our original policy that was mentioned in the tax message of 1961. Our
idea then was that the first tax bill would be passed in 1961, and that we
would come along the next year with the overall tax cut. We didn’t, at that
time know the exact size of the tax cut that we would propose, but we did know
that we wanted to reduce the top rates to the area of 65 or 70 percent and
other rates accordingly. We didn’t know how much we could make up in the way of
reforms that would broaden the base. At that time we thought we could make up
more than later proved possible.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Despite this
contemporaneous record, a number of later commentators have advanced a
different account, attributing the Kennedy tax program primarily to Walter
Heller, Paul Samuelson, and the Council of Economic Advisers. Although this
interpretation has become common, it lacks documentary support. Reflecting this
view, Alan S. Blinder—former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a
member of President Clinton’s </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Council of
Economic Advisers—offered the following characterization of the Kennedy
program:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>Indeed, the premier such textbook of the
day was written by MIT’s Paul Samuelson (1948), who was the acknowledged
intellectual leader of Kennedy’s team of economists even though he never took a
position in Washington. Perhaps the most important and obvious feature of the
New Economics was that the Kennedy–Johnson tax cut was the first deliberate and
avowedly Keynesian action ever taken by the U.S. government. While the ideas
were not new, acting on them was.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>44</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Blinder
correctly observes that the ideas behind the Kennedy tax cuts were not original
to the 1960s, but he contends that acting on them was novel. Yet the essential
rationale had already been applied in the Mellon tax program of the early
1920s, where reductions in marginal rates were similarly justified as a means
of stimulating work, investment, economic growth, and reducing avoidance.
Further evaluating that interpretation requires distinguishing between Keynes’s
own writings and the later Keynesian framework developed by his interpreters.
Keynes offered no sustained analysis of income taxation in his early book-length
works, including: </span><em><span >Indian
Currency and Finance</span></em><span >
(1913), </span><em><span >The Economic
Consequences of the Peace</span></em><span >
(1920), and </span><em><span >A Treatise
on Probability</span></em><span > (1921),
and he did not address the subject directly until </span><em><span
>A Tract on Monetary Reform</span></em><span
> (1923), where his remarks concerned the
fiscal effects of inflation. In one representative passage from 1923, he wrote:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>Just as a toll can be levied on the use
of roads or a turnover tax on business transactions, so also on the use of
money. The higher the toll and the tax, the less traffic on the roads, and the
less business transacted, so also the less money carried. But some traffic is
so indispensable, some business so profitable, some money-payments so
convenient, that only a very high levy will stop completely all traffic, all
business, all payments. A Government has to remember, however, that even if a
tax is not prohibitive it may be unprofitable, and that a medium, rather than
an extreme, imposition will yield the greatest gain.<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>45</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in'><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in'><span >This
analogy illustrates the principle that taxation beyond a certain point becomes
self-defeating—a concept well established among classical economists and later
reaffirmed by Treasury Secretaries Carter Glass, David Houston, and Andrew
Mellon. Presidents from both parties adopted similar reasoning, among them
Democrat Woodrow Wilson and Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge.  Each
described a similar behavioral response to excessive taxation: that rates set
too high defeat their own purpose by discouraging productive effort and eroding
the revenue base.</span></p>

<p><span >In </span><em><span
>The General Theory</span></em><span
>, Keynes returned to this theme.
Although he wrote only briefly about taxation, his observations reveal an
awareness of the practical limits of redistribution:</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>Since the end of the nineteenth century
significant progress towards the removal of very great disparities of wealth
and income has been achieved through the instrument of direct taxation—income
tax and surtax and death duties—especially in Great Britain. Many people would
wish to see this process carried much further, but they are deterred by two
considerations; partly by the fear of making skilful evasions too much worth
while and also of diminishing unduly the motive towards risk-taking, but
mainly, I think, by the belief that the growth of capital depends upon the
strength of the motive towards individual saving and that for a large
proportion of this growth we are dependent on the savings of the rich out of
their superfluity.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>46</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Here Keynes
acknowledges behavioral mechanics that are central to incentive-based analysis:
excessively high marginal rates discourage risk-taking, encourage avoidance,
and divert capital from productive use, while more moderate rates sustain
saving and investment. Though he never developed this point into a formal
doctrine of tax-incentive policy, his recognition of these limits accords with
the classical principles of public finance. While Keynes advocated
deficit-financed public spending as a response to severe economic contraction
in the early 1930s, he did not articulate a general or symmetric framework of
countercyclical fiscal policy. That conception was formalized only after the
war by economists such as Abba Lerner, Alvin Hansen, and Paul Samuelson. Late
in his life, Keynes had already grown wary of the doctrinal certainty forming
around his ideas. Reflecting on a 1946 meeting in Washington dominated by
economists invoking his framework, he remarked, “I found myself the only
non-Keynesian present.”</span> <a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >47</span></span></a></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Contemporary
and retrospective debates often frame the Kennedy tax program as a contest
between demand-side and supply-side theories. This distinction is overstated.
Supply and demand are complementary aspects of the same economic transactions,
and any reduction in marginal tax rates necessarily increases households’
disposable income. The relevant distinction is therefore not whether demand is
affected—it invariably is—but how. Incentive-based tax reform can raise private
demand indirectly by improving the expected returns to work, investment, and
risk-taking, rather than through deficit-financed public expenditure. President
Kennedy’s frequent references to “demand” reflected the political language of
the period and do not imply that the program relied on government spending to
substitute for private activity. The subsequent pattern of fiscal receipts and
outlays therefore allows the program’s operative mechanisms to be tested
empirically rather than inferred from rhetoric.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Clarifying
the origins of the Kennedy tax program helps to resolve the interpretive dispute;
the historical record that followed its enactment shows how taxpayers responded
in practice. Following the full implementation of the act, the number of tax
units reporting incomes above $100,000 increased substantially, alongside
rising real adjusted gross income and a marked increase in real receipts from
this group. The observed expansion in high-income filers, real AGI, and
receipts indicates that marginal tax rates materially shape reporting behavior
and the breadth of the tax base.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Although
this analysis focuses on the upper strata of income earners, the same pattern
appears across the higher brackets. While some rate reductions took effect in
1964, the full impact of the act appeared in 1965. Rational economic behavior
implies that more labor will be supplied and greater risks undertaken when the
taxpayer retains thirty cents of every additional dollar earned above the top
threshold rather than nine—a 233 percent increase in the marginal after-tax return.
If the incentive effects were illusory, an alternative mechanism would need to
explain the abrupt increase in both the number of high-income filers and their
growing share of total federal income tax receipts documented in Table 12.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Data from
several decades have been reviewed, and the only other period exhibiting a
comparable surge in top-strata filers occurred in the latter half of the 1920s.
Table 13 presents data from the preceding decade, illustrating the extent of
the structural break from prior norms. The 1950s, shaped by the Korean War and
several recessions, saw only modest and intermittent changes to the tax code.
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 reorganized and modernized existing law but
left marginal rates, exemptions, and the basic structure virtually unchanged. As
a result, its effects on taxpayer behavior and revenue appear limited, and the
disincentives of the postwar tax regime largely remained in place throughout
the period. During the entire decade, marginal rates for the cohort earning
above $100,000 never fell below 75 percent at the low end and remained as high
as 91 percent at the top. The number of returns, adjusted gross income, and
revenues recorded in those years all pale in comparison with the figures observed
after the Revenue Act of 1964.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Several
features of these tables warrant closer inspection. The absence of observable
bracket creep among top incomes during the 1951 inflation spike (7.9 percent
annual rate) suggests that reported income at the top had already become
largely decoupled from nominal growth.</span> <span >Even
as reported top incomes rose through the late 1950s, receipts did not keep
pace. High marginal rates discouraged taxable exposure, and the postwar
code—systematized in 1954—made deferral and incorporation increasingly
attractive. A comparison of high-income filers in 1950 and 1959 is particularly
revealing.</span> <span >In 1959, roughly
7,400 additional returns were filed, real AGI was higher, yet revenue was
lower. This episode followed the 1958 recession, when profits and capital gains
rebounded strongly, but the muted revenue response underscores the behavioral
effects of high marginal rates—deferral, incorporation, and selective
realization—that persisted throughout the decade. These distortions were cited
explicitly by Kennedy’s Treasury as justification for rate reform in 1963.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Once again,
the high marginal tax rates of the 1950s appear misaligned with the incentive
structure required to translate economic growth into reported top-end income
and revenue. Despite strong aggregate performance in years such as 1950–51,
1955, and 1959, reported income and tax payments at the top of the distribution
remained largely flat. Data from the fourteen years preceding 1964 show
remarkable stability in the number of filers, adjusted gross income, and total
revenue collected from tax units earning above $100,000. As previously shown in
Figures 2 and 3, reported top incomes had remained persistently depressed in
every year since 1916 outside the brief window following the Mellon reforms. It
is therefore difficult to attribute the sharp acceleration in top-end reporting
after 1964 to coincidence, given that it occurred immediately following
substantial reductions in top marginal rates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Although
revenue outcomes are not the primary metric of economic performance, they were
explicitly cited by Kennedy. In that context, contemporaneous forecasts issued
by the Bureau of the Budget (later the Office of Management and Budget) provide
an additional point of reference. These projections were not fixed forecasts
made prior to reform, but rolling estimates updated annually by the Bureau of
the Budget as part of the federal budget process. In the year immediately
preceding the cuts, the Bureau’s projection exceeded actual revenue by $6.9
billion. For each of the four years following the Revenue Act of 1964, however,
its estimates fell well short of realized receipts—by a cumulative $23.6
billion between 1964 and 1967, with individual income tax revenue undershot by
$15.7 billion. Taxpayer behavior adjusted in ways that static revenue
projections were not designed to capture. While the projections assumed that
individual receipts would drop mechanically in line with the rate decrease,
this is not what transpired. There was a real individual revenue increase in
1964 followed by a slight drop in 1965, but this occurred as the top strata
receipts increased significantly. Even as the Bureau revised its forecasts
annually to incorporate the latest data, projections continued to undershoot realized
receipts through the mid-1960s</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >After four
consecutive years of revenue underprojection, the Bureau did not overestimate
receipts again until 1968—coinciding with the enactment of a temporary 10
percent surtax—when its forecasting assumptions shifted abruptly. This episode highlights
the fragility of static revenue forecasting in periods of structural tax
change. Projections that hold taxpayer behavior constant implicitly assume that
changes in statutory rates do not alter reporting, realization, or
participation decisions—an assumption that the historical record challenges.
During periods of rate reduction, static models systematically understated
revenues by failing to anticipate behavioral expansion of the tax base. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In 1968,
despite robust output growth and rising nominal individual income tax receipts,
total federal receipts declined in real terms. A surge in capital-gains
realizations temporarily inflated nominal collections, but accelerating
inflation eroded their real value. At the same time, corporate tax receipts
contracted sharply, offsetting gains elsewhere. This divergence reflects the
extent to which short-run revenue movements reflect compositional and timing
effects rather than changes in underlying economic capacity. Moreover, the year
1968 exposed a rational behavioral mechanism that would recur in later decades.
Anticipation of higher future capital gains taxation prompted an extraordinary
acceleration of realizations, producing a record year relative to GDP that
would not be exceeded until 1985. As in subsequent episodes, the surge proved
transitory, reflecting intertemporal shifting rather than a durable increase in
taxable capital income. Short-run revenue responses of this kind are neither
evidence of nor refutation against the long-run effects of tax policy on
economic growth, which depend on sustained incentives rather than transitional
timing effects.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Returning to
the mechanics of the Revenue Act of 1964, it has been claimed that cutting
taxes to sustain an expansion, rather than to counter a recession, was unique
to the Kennedy program. Yet the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 were enacted
under similar circumstances—a healthy economy and the conviction that improved
incentives could enhance, not merely sustain, performance. A related assertion
is that the 1964 cuts functioned as Keynesian-style stimulus, reinforced by
contemporaneous increases in domestic spending. A demand-stimulus
interpretation would imply declining revenues and an expansion of public
outlays—neither appears in the data. The historical record allows these claims
to be tested empirically</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span >President
Kennedy pointedly rejected the claim that his tax program was intended as a
deficit-financed stimulus. In his December 1962 address to the Economic Club of
New York, he stated:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>But the most direct and significant kind of
Federal action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in
private consumption and investment demand--to cut the fetters which hold back
private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the increased use
of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments situation today
places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. It could also be done by
increasing Federal expenditures more rapidly than necessary, but such a course
would soon demoralize both the Government and our economy. If Government is to
retain the confidence of the people, it must not spend more than can be
justified on grounds of national need or spent with maximum efficiency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span >In
short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government’s most
useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public
expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private
expenditures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>Other national problems, moreover, will be aided
by full employment. It will encourage the location of new plants in areas of

facilitate the adjustment which will be necessary under our new trade expansion

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>Nevertheless, as Chairman Mills of the House Ways
and Means Committee pointed out this week, the size of the deficit is to be
regarded with concern, and tax reduction must be accompanied, in his words, by
&quot;increased control of the rises in expenditures.&quot; This is precisely
the course we intend to follow in 1963.</span><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >49</span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy’s
emphasis on private investment, expenditure restraint, and the limits of
deficit spending contrasts sharply with later characterizations of the 1964 tax
cut as a countercyclical, demand-driven measure. A month later, in his Special
Message to the Congress on Tax Reduction and Reform (January 24, 1963), he clarified
his position:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>It would be a grave mistake to require
that any tax reduction today be offset by a corresponding cut in expenditures.
In my judgment, I have proposed the minimum level of Federal expenditures
needed for the security of the Nation, for meeting the challenge facing us in
space, and for the wellbeing of our people. Moreover, the gains in demand from
tax reduction would then be offset—or more than offset—by the loss of demand
due to the reduction in Government spending. The incentive effects of tax
reduction would remain, but total jobs and output would shrink as Government
contracts were cut back, workers were laid off and projects were ended.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>On the other hand, I do not favor
raising demand by a massive increase in Government expenditures. In today’s
circumstances, it is desirable to seek expansion through our free market
processes—to place increased spending power in the hands of private consumers
and investors and offer more encouragement to private initiative. The most
effective policy, therefore, is to expand demand and unleash incentives through
a program of tax reduction and reform, coupled with the most prudent possible
policy of public expenditures.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>50</span></a> </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The 1964 tax
cut is often framed as a Keynesian initiative, with emphasis placed on
Kennedy’s assertion that tax reductions need not be matched by immediate
spending cuts, while giving less attention to the incentive-oriented design and
longer-run supply considerations embedded in the legislation.</span> <span
>From this, it is inferred that the
economy exhibited “slack” and that the tax cut therefore operated as
countercyclical stimulus. Neither inference establishes mechanism. Measures of
economic slack—output gaps, capacity utilization, and related estimates—are
inherently model-dependent and uncertain ex ante. For that reason, the presence
of slack does not, by itself, identify whether subsequent expansion reflects
demand-driven stimulus or incentive-induced changes in work, investment, and
reporting behavior. To treat any tax reduction enacted during a period later
judged to exhibit slack as inherently countercyclical risks collapsing the
distinction between stabilization and incentive reform and substitutes
classification for causal demonstration.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy’s
statements clarify the logic of his program. In this context, “demand” did not denote
government expenditure as an autonomous source of spending, but to the private
side of every transaction—consumption and investment—whose magnitude is shaped
by after-tax incentives rather than by public outlays. Demand effects and
incentive effects are not mutually exclusive; the question is which mechanism
predominated. The experience following the Revenue Act of 1964 reinforces this
logic: revenue outcomes cannot be inferred from statutory rate changes alone,
but depend critically on timing, income composition, and behavioral
response—precisely the mechanisms illustrated in the preceding tables. Table 15
extends this view to the broader fiscal mechanics of the decade.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;background:white'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black'>If the post-1964 expansion had been driven chiefly by short-run,
deficit-financed fiscal stimulus, we would expect the policy environment to
exhibit characteristics typical of demand-management episodes: a deliberate
reliance on public borrowing to elevate aggregate spending, temporary relief
calibrated to cyclical conditions, and revenue performance broadly consistent
with static rate reductions absent strong base effects. The historical record
does not align with that pattern. Revenues rose in real terms, the federal
revenue share of GDP increased, and growth was accompanied by expanding private
activity without immediate inflationary absorption of nominal gains. Only
toward the end of the decade, as fiscal and monetary policy shifted, did those
relationships deteriorate.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The stated
philosophy and observed mechanics are more closely aligned with the economic
logic that would later be described as “supply-side,” although that terminology
did not emerge until the 1970s. Because the term has often been caricatured in
subsequent debates as endorsing tax cuts without accompanying spending discipline,
it is important to recall the analytical logic that originally motivated it. As
Alan Reynolds explained, “Supply-side tax policy is about raising tax revenues
in ways that do the least damage to the private economy. Spending cuts are
entirely consistent with supply-side theory because (1) transfer payments that
phase out with rising income are a disincentive to work and (2) government
purchases divert real resources into unproductive uses.” <a href="#_ftn51"

style='color:black;background:white'>51</span></span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >GDP growth
was robust in 1962, and federal receipts had already begun accelerating prior
to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964. These developments coincided with
the implementation of the Revenue Act of 1962, alongside cyclical recovery and
broader structural forces, making it difficult to disentangle incentive effects
from contemporaneous macroeconomic dynamics. The 1964 tax reform therefore
operated on an economy already in expansion rather than initiating the upswing
itself, a pattern consistent with the mid-1920s reforms. At the same time, the
postwar economy had experienced earlier output surges in 1955 and 1959 that
failed to develop into sustained growth. It was this pattern of episodic acceleration
followed by stagnation that informed Kennedy’s emphasis on tax reform as a
means of reinforcing durable expansion rather than relying on recurrent
stimulus alone. In that context, the fiscal easing associated with the Revenue
Act of 1964 helped extend and stabilize an expansion that might otherwise have
proven transient.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Although
Kennedy did not live to see the 1964 tax program carried into effect, the
spending pattern of 1964–65 remained consistent with the policy framework he
had articulated. The subsequent upswing in federal outlays reflected the
Vietnam buildup rather than any contemporaneous departure from that design.
Defense accounted for the largest share of the 1966 increase, but several
civilian agencies—including Health and Human Services, Education, NASA, and
Social Security—also expanded during this period, indicating that rising
expenditures were not confined to military commitments.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This pattern
is instructive. The major Great Society initiatives of the late 1960s were not
legislatively linked to the Revenue Act of 1964 and were conceptually distinct
from its design. Subsequent revenue growth and strong economic performance
appear to have encouraged Congress to undertake additional domestic
commitments. In that sense, the sequence aligns with Kennedy’s own argument
that lower marginal rates would stimulate growth and expand the revenue
base—while also illustrating a recurring feature of U.S. fiscal history: when
revenues rise, they are often treated as usable fiscal capacity rather than as
an opportunity for balance. Table 16 provides the agency-level detail.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >One notable
distinction between the Kennedy tax cuts and those of the 1920s, or of later
reforms, is the limited relief provided to the least affluent. Rates fell
across all brackets, but personal exemptions—unchanged since 1948—and the
standard deduction remained fixed in nominal terms. While the largest statutory
rate reductions occurred at the top, the distributional effects of the 1964 tax
program were more balanced than the schedule alone might suggest. Even without targeted
provisions, the share of the federal tax burden borne by these groups declined
over the latter half of the decade as real income gains moved many tax units
into higher brackets. Table 17 shows the pronounced reduction in the relative
burden on lower-income tax units following the Revenue Act of 1964. For
context, per capita personal income was approximately $2,752 and median family
income about $6,600 in 1964.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Revenue
Act of 1964 was not intended to alleviate poverty or redistribute income, but
to alter taxpayer behavior by improving incentives for work, investment, and
productive activity. As capital is committed to new plants and enterprises, the
earliest observable effects typically appear in hiring and production, with
rising labor demand lifting wages. The marked decline in filers reporting under
$5,000 after 1964 aligns with expansion-driven income gains rather than
alterations to filing requirements. Many tax units moved out of the lowest
income bracket, while those who remained faced substantially lower liabilities
under the new rate schedule.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Although President
Johnson made enactment of Kennedy’s tax program a top priority, he approached
it as a political expedient, useful for securing early legislative momentum and
advantageous for the 1964 campaign. His view of the cuts as a near-term measure
contrasted with Kennedy’s aim of a lasting restructuring of fiscal policy. Speaking
to the Economic Club of New York in December 1962, Kennedy made clear that he
was not seeking a transient stimulus:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
background:white'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:black;
background:white'>I am not talking about a “quickie” or a temporary tax cut,
which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking
about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary
complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that
our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II
to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it
siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business
purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort,
investment, and risk-taking.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>53</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;background:white'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black'>These statements further clarify the fiscal tenets that
accompanied the general policy environment of the early 1960s, when monetary
discipline remained a central objective. Johnson gradually moved away from that
framework. During his presidency, pressure for easier credit coincided with an
acceleration in liquidity that accommodated rapidly rising federal
outlays—roughly 38 percent higher in real terms between 1965 and 1968.<a
href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>54</span></a>
The resulting policy mix departed sharply from the earlier emphasis on monetary
restraint paired with growth-oriented taxation. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A temporary
surcharge was introduced under the Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 as a limited
demand-management measure. It raised effective tax burdens by applying a
proportional add-on to computed liabilities, without altering statutory
marginal rate schedules or income brackets. The Revenue and Expenditure Control
Act of 1968 marked the first explicit and comprehensive countercyclical
consolidation. Signed that June, the act paired general tax increases with
spending restraint, imposing a temporary 10-percent income tax surcharge on
individual and corporate liabilities and effectively reversing much of the
Kennedy-era rate relief.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
sequence aligns closely with the countercyclical fiscal doctrine articulated by
Paul Samuelson, who argued that when private investment rises excessively,
government should compensate through higher taxes and restrained expenditures.
The policies adopted in 1968–1969 broadly reflected that logic: federal taxes
were raised, the growth of expenditures slowed and then reversed, and the
budget moved into surplus by 1969. This tightening offset a substantial portion
of the earlier impetus from the 1964 tax reductions and marked a clear
departure from the policy framework that had supported the mid-decade
expansion. Economic conditions deteriorated soon thereafter. By 1970,
unemployment had risen, real GDP growth slowed to near zero, and inflation
continued to accelerate.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
difficulty with attributing the Revenue Act of 1964 to this countercyclical
framework is chronological as much as theoretical. There was no depression or
recession when the act was proposed or enacted. Kennedy’s program was intended
to reinforce an ongoing expansion by improving incentives and expanding
productive capacity—not to restrain a boom or counteract “overheating.” The
conditions to which Samuelson’s prescription applied simply did not exist in
1963–1964.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As Kennedy
stated plainly in his 1962 address to the Economic Club of New York:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>Our true
choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of
large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter
what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an
economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to
balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.
Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by
wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions, and any
new recession would break all deficit records.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax
rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to
raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. The experience of a
number of European countries and Japan have borne this out. This country's own
experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is
that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave
the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a
budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can

our practical choice is not between a tax-cut deficit and a budgetary surplus.
It is between two kinds of deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the
unwanted result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy; or a temporary
deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut designed to boost the economy,
increase tax revenues, and achieve--and I believe this can be done--a budget
surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness; the second

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Kennedy’s
reasoning stood in contrast to the stabilization framework advanced in postwar
Keynesian textbooks, which emphasized deliberate fiscal restraint during
periods of prosperity. While Samuelson acknowledged that revenues rise
automatically during expansions, his model centered on discretionary tax
increases and spending restraint to temper growth. With the exception of the
modest and temporary surcharge in 1966, fiscal conditions from 1964 through
1967 moved in the opposite direction; revenues rose because growth accelerated
following rate reductions, not because policymakers tightened fiscal policy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A genuinely
countercyclical shift occurred only in 1968, when taxes were raised and
expenditures restrained in accordance with the compensatory doctrine. That
shift preceded—not followed—the subsequent slowdown. The empirical record
therefore distinguishes between the incentive-based framework under which the
mid-decade expansion unfolded and the stabilization logic that governed policy
at the decade’s end.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Following
the Revenue Acts of 1962 and 1964, the U.S. economy sustained an expansion at a
pace not previously observed in peacetime. While demographic growth, education,
and technological progress contributed to this outcome, fiscal and monetary
stability were central in converting those structural advantages into durable
gains. The expansion unfolded within the policy mix Kennedy outlined, while the
subsequent slowdown coincided with departures from that framework. Table 18
summarizes the principal indicators of economic performance throughout the
decade.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Paul
Samuelson’s postwar textbook exerted wide influence, and his contributions to the
study of economics were substantial. His articulation of countercyclical
compensatory policy is discussed here because Heller and Blinder later
attributed the intellectual origins of the Revenue Act of 1964 to the Keynesian
framework popularized in postwar textbooks—an attribution that is not supported
by the contemporaneous record, the stated rationale of the act, or the
mechanics of the legislation itself. Kennedy’s statements on taxation and
economic growth drew on a long-standing tradition that emphasized incentives,
investment, and the productive use of capital. Viewed in that context, the continuity
is evident: Kennedy’s logic drew from an established analytical lineage that
later came to be described—though not at the time labeled—as supply-side
economics.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><a name="OLE_LINK1"><span >&nbsp;</span></a></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Alan
Reynolds summarizes the framework succinctly: “The supply-side innovation, from
Nobel Laureate Bob Mundell, was to suggest that (1) monetary policy is the
right tool to keep inflation in check, and (2) the focus of tax policy should
be shifted from short-term accounting results (deficits) toward improving
longer-term incentives for productive work and investment. The first part of
that package is actually monetarist, and neither part ever ceases to be
relevant to inflation and economic growth, respectively.” </span><a

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
difficulties of the late 1960s and 1970s are more plausibly associated with a
retreat from mid-decade fiscal and monetary discipline, compounded by major
external shocks, than with Kennedy’s earlier policy approach. The policy mix
later associated with Robert Mundell—fiscal ease paired with monetary
restraint—had antecedents in the 1920s and was realized again in the 1980s. The
term “supply-side economics” did not enter common usage until the late 1970s
and has since become entwined with political debates, but the mechanism it
describes is neither new nor unique to any later period. Its central elements
trace back through Kennedy and Mellon to the classical economists of the
eighteenth century, whose analyses emphasized incentives, production, and the
efficient allocation of capital. Analyses that confine supply-side theory to
statutory tax changes alone omit a central component of its logic. Fiscal
incentives operate within a monetary framework that shapes credit conditions,
capital formation, and the translation of incentives into real activity;
abstracting from this interaction leaves the analysis incomplete.</span></p>

<p><span >Upon President Ronald Reagan
taking office in 1981, the economy stood at the center of the new
administration’s agenda. Reagan and his advisers inherited a profound economic
crisis that persisted for most of the prior decade. The late 1970s had been
defined by a policy mix directly at odds with the framework that had guided the
Kennedy program: loose monetary policy, steadily rising effective tax burdens
through bracket creep, and expanding federal outlays. The result was a
sustained period of economic deterioration. Output slowed, real incomes
stagnated, and the country endured the damaging combination of high unemployment
and high inflation—stagflation. By 1980, the term itself understated the
severity of conditions; the economy had begun to contract even as inflation
accelerated to among the highest sustained peacetime levels in American
history, leaving many Americans struggling simply to maintain their standard of
living. Table 19 illustrates the depth and duration of this crisis and the economic
environment confronting the Reagan administration on taking office. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >The incoming
president framed these conditions in his Inaugural Address on January 20, 1981,
emphasizing both their human cost and the time required to reverse them: “The
business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an
economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of
the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our
economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the
fixed-income elderly alike. Idle industries have cast workers into
unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. Those who do work are
denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity. The economic ills
we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in
days, weeks, or months, but they will go away.” <a href="#_ftn57"
name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>57</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
concerns reflected the prevailing economic conditions rather than mere rhetoric.
By the end of the 1970s, the federal income tax was being administered under
statutory rates that had not permanently changed since the Revenue Act of 1964,
even as the economic context shifted dramatically. The Tax Reform Act of 1969
introduced a 50 percent maximum marginal rate on income classified as “earned,”
but the scope was narrow, its interaction with existing shelters and income
reclassification muted any impact on actual liabilities, and it left most
ordinary investment income—such as interest and dividends—subject to rates up
to 70–77 percent. It did not generate clearly measurable behavioral or revenue
effects comparable to earlier or later tax reforms.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Throughout
the 1970s, persistent inflation—combined with an unindexed rate schedule—pushed
tax units into higher nominal brackets without corresponding gains in real
income. Effective tax burdens rose mechanically, through bracket creep, rather
than through deliberate legislative choice. Table 20 and Table 21 present high
income returns between 1970 and 1978. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In nominal
terms, the percentage increase in tax units and adjusted gross income bore
nearly a one-to-one relationship. Measured in real terms, however, the 1970s
saw adjusted gross income rise by only 41 percent of the increase in the number
of returns—a pattern reminiscent of the postwar 1950s, when real AGI actually
contracted despite a larger filing base. However, the figures are not directly
comparable. The earlier distortion arose from avoidance behavior induced by
confiscatory rates; in the 1970s, similar responses persisted but were
compounded by inflation and nominal bracket drift. Both episodes show how a
static rate structure, whether the rigid postwar schedule or unindexed
brackets, separated reported income from the real economy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By contrast,
the same relationship measured 81 percent from 1960 to 1968, 90 percent from
1980 to 1988, and 80 percent from 1992 to 2000—periods when rate structures
were better aligned with real growth. This occurred when inflation was
relatively subdued, and, after 1985, brackets were indexed to maintain that
alignment. While this relationship provides a useful indicator of how closely
the tax code tracks underlying economic conditions, it is shaped by changes in
filer composition, capital gains realizations, demographic shifts, and evolving
definitions of taxable income. These influences do not negate the pattern but
caution against treating the ratios as a pure behavioral metric. Table 21.1 further
illustrates this dynamic.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
figures indicate that the apparent buoyancy of late-1970s income tax receipts
was largely an artifact of inflation interacting with an unindexed code. A
marked increase in top end filers did not produce proportionately higher real
AGI or revenues; instead, inflation eroded the real value of exemptions and
brackets, pulling tax units upward and distorting the distribution of reported
income. The later implementation of rate reductions and the adoption of
indexation were, in this sense, not simply tax cuts but a correction of a
system whose nominal structure had drifted far from real economic conditions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:black;
background:white'>President Reagan explained the mechanics of bracket creep in
1981: </span><span >“For all practical
purposes, this was the equivalent of taxes being significantly raised every
year. Bracket creep is an insidious tax. Let me give an example. If you earned
$10,000 a year in 1972, by 1980 you had to earn $19,700 just to stay even with
inflation. But that's before taxes. Come April 15th, you'll find your tax rates
have increased 30 percent. Now, if you've been wondering why you don't seem as
well-off as you were a few years back, it's because government makes a profit
on inflation. It gets an automatic tax increase without having to vote on it.
We intend to stop that.” <a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>58</span></a> A central objective of the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) was thus not only to reduce marginal rates but
to end bracket creep by indexing the tax system to inflation beginning in 1985.
In effect, Reagan sought to close a structural feature of the tax code—one that
expanded federal fiscal capacity at the expense of taxpayers and concealed a
rising tax burden behind unchanged nominal rates.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Because the
prevailing monetary regime sets the binding constraints under which both fiscal
and monetary policy operate, it is important to frame the general landscape of
monetary policy. With President </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span
>Richard Nixon</span></span><span
>’s closure of the gold window in 1971,
the United States fully abandoned the Bretton Woods system and the dollar’s
gold convertibility. Freed from that external discipline, the Federal Reserve
gained far greater latitude over monetary policy. Nominal conditions shifted
repeatedly as policymakers alternated between restraint and accommodation: when
inflation accelerated, the Fed briefly tightened; when it appeared to ease,
policy quickly reversed course. Although its stability was increasingly
questioned, the Phillips Curve remained influential during the 1970s, and
policymakers repeatedly attempted to manage inflation and unemployment within a
perceived short-run tradeoff framework. Inflation in the 1970s reflected both
real shocks and repeated policy accommodation; what mattered for the tax system
was not the initial impulse, but the persistence of nominal instability, which
is clearly visible in the behavior of monetary aggregates and other nominal
indicators.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The consequences
were severe. Inflation expectations became unanchored, price instability
compounded real economic stagnation, and capital fled to hard assets. Gold,
trading around $38 per ounce in early 1971, rose to roughly $653 per ounce by
January 1980—a seventeen-fold nominal increase and a stark market verdict on
monetary credibility. Gold briefly spiked to $850 intraday that month,
reflecting acute inflation anxiety. By the end of the decade, inflation
remained above ten percent despite repeated anti-inflation measures, wage-price
controls, and political assurances that relief was imminent.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Following
President </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span >Jimmy
Carter</span></span><span >’s appointment
of </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span >Paul
Volcker</span></span><span > as Federal
Reserve Chair in 1979, the policy regime began to shift. Volcker viewed
inflation as a structural problem requiring restored monetary discipline. In
October 1979, the Federal Reserve altered its operating procedures, moving away
from interest-rate smoothing toward reserve-based targets, allowing short-term
rates to adjust as needed. Although the Fed never achieved precise control over
money growth, the shift signaled a credible commitment to disinflation. As
policy tightened through 1980–81, inflation expectations gradually broke—a
painful but ultimately successful correction. The 1979–82 period became known
as the Federal Reserve’s “monetarist experiment.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Federal
Reserve operates independently, but the success of its disinflation policy
required political backing. The incoming</span><span class=whitespace-normal><span
> Reagan</span></span><span

restoring price stability would entail recession, high interest rates, and
considerable short-term hardship, but it supported the effort nonetheless.<a
href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>59</span></a>
That political alignment reduced pressure on the Federal Reserve to reverse
course prematurely and allowed monetary restraint to persist long enough to
reanchor inflation expectations. Inflation was reversed not by chance but
through sustained monetary discipline. Incentive-based fiscal reforms would
operate on a separate margin, supporting productivity, investment, and growth
once the end of accelerating inflation had been achieved.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With the

class=whitespace-normal><span >President

legislation reducing the top statutory capital gains rate from 49 percent to 28

Representative </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span style='font-family:

and Senator </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span >William
Roth</span></span><span > advanced
sweeping marginal rate reductions, first introduced in 1977 and debated
throughout 1978. The proposal gained visibility but did not advance to
enactment amid congressional opposition and persistent concerns over inflation
and deficits. Nonetheless, it provided the legislative template for the reforms
that soon followed.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Many
economists viewed the Kemp-Roth tax cuts with caution. In 1978, the
Congressional Budget Office voiced concerns, warning: “The fundamental issue
arising from a commitment to Roth-Kemp tax cuts can be stated simply: Will the
growth in productive capacity induced by greater incentives to work, save, and
invest be large enough and rapid enough to prevent widespread shortages and
accelerated inflation? The available evidence provides no reason for an
optimistic answer to this question.” <a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>60</span></a>  Such views affirmed the uncertainties
surrounding major fiscal reform when both inflation and unemployment were at
modern highs.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The economic
turmoil of the 1970s translated into electoral change. After enduring rising
prices, eroding real wages, and repeated policy failures, voters signaled a
decisive shift in 1980. Ronald Reagan won a commanding victory, Republicans
gained significant ground in the House, and—for the first time since
1955—secured a majority in either chamber by taking the Senate. That
twenty-six-year lapse in Republican control is notable, as it underscores the
magnitude of the shift; fiscal reform now had both electoral legitimacy and a
viable legislative path. This realignment, combined with sustained advocacy
from supply-side proponents and Reagan’s own commitment to tax reform, created
the conditions in which the Kemp–Roth framework could finally be enacted. These
forces converged in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, making fundamental tax
reform both politically feasible and economically necessary.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >President
Reagan articulated the core of his economic program to Congress in February
1981. He argued that spending restraint and comprehensive rate reductions had
to proceed together if recovery was to take hold, and that restoring incentives
was essential to job creation and renewed productivity. The proposed 30-percent
phased reduction, he stressed, was not a giveaway but a correction—an offset to
the automatic tax increases embedded in an unindexed code. Unlike prior reforms
that shifted liabilities among different groups, the administration presented
its plan as an equal, across-the-board rate cut designed to broaden prosperity
by improving incentives for work, saving, and investment—expanding
opportunities for all Americans.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>61</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:black;
background:white'>                  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >The Economic
Recovery Tax Act originated in the Democratic-controlled House and ultimately
passed both chambers with large bipartisan majorities on final conference
adoption in August 1981 (House 282–95; Senate 67–8), underscoring that the
shift toward marginal-rate reduction extended beyond partisan alignment.<a
href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>62</span></a>
The act followed the same principles evident in earlier episodes of successful
tax reform: broad, across-the-board marginal rate reductions, with the largest
percentage decreases applied to the highest brackets. The purpose was to
restore incentives to work, save, and invest, redirect capital toward
productive activity, and promote economic expansion.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Although the
administration originally proposed a 30-percent across-the-board reduction in
marginal personal rates, the enacted measure yielded a phased-in 25-percent
reduction in overall individual tax liability between 1981 and 1983. The
statutory rate schedule (Table 22) shows that marginal rates declined unevenly
across brackets, generally between 16 and 28 percent, reflecting the mechanics
of the phase-in and bracket adjustments rather than a uniform percentage cut.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >ERTA’s major
provisions included comprehensive reductions in marginal income tax rates,
inflation indexing, and measures to encourage capital formation. The top
marginal rate, previously 70 percent, fell to 50 percent effective January 1,
1982. All other brackets received reductions totaling 25 percent, phased in as
a 5-percent cut on October 1, 1981, followed by 10-percent cuts in mid-1982 and
mid-1983. Beginning in 1985, tax brackets were indexed to inflation, ending the
bracket-creep mechanism that had raised effective tax burdens throughout the
1970s. The capital gains rate was reduced from 28 percent to </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >20 percent,
extending the shift toward lower taxation of investment returns begun in 1978. The

depreciation schedules and expanding investment incentives, including
rehabilitation credits for older structures.</span></p>

address to a joint session of Congress, Reagan laid out a comprehensive
economic agenda: “The plan consists of four parts: (1) a substantial reduction
in the growth of Federal expenditures; (2) a significant reduction in Federal
tax rates; (3) prudent relief of Federal regulatory burdens; and (4) a monetary
policy on the part of the independent Federal Reserve System which is
consistent with those policies.”</span> <a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >63</span></span></a><span
> These four priorities soon became known
collectively as “Reaganomics,” reflecting their presentation as a unified
economic program. In practice, three of the four were substantially
implemented: Federal Reserve policy remained tight, marginal tax rates were
reduced, and regulatory rollback continued (though not beyond the scale
initiated in the late-Carter years). The fourth element, spending restraint,
proved far more difficult. While some non-defense discretionary outlays slowed,
overall expenditure growth was dominated by pre-existing entitlement
commitments and the lagged effects of prior inflation. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Defense
outlays also rose substantially but represented only one component of a broader
and largely inherited spending trajectory. Even before ERTA’s enactment,
President Reagan was adamant that restoring military capacity to keep pace with
the Soviet Union was non-negotiable. He emphasized that “cutting” spending
referred to slowing the rate of growth rather than reducing nominal levels: “An
expanding population, a growing economy, and a difficult international
environment all lead to the need for year-to-year rises in government spending.
The effort to ‘cut’ the budget really refers to reducing the amount of increase
in spending requested from one year to the next.” <a href="#_ftn64"

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The early
1980s brought a severe contraction, the deepest recession since the 1930s in
terms of unemployment. This downturn, however, had roots predating President
Reagan’s inauguration. Inflation had been running in double digits for nearly
two years and peaked above 14 percent in 1980. To break the inflation cycle,
the Federal Reserve implemented a forceful monetary contraction. The federal
funds rate climbed into the high teens, and the prime rate exceeded 20 percent
in late 1980.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>65</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Nominal
monetary conditions tightened sharply. Short-term rates were allowed to rise
without restraint, credit conditions deteriorated, and growth in monetary
aggregates slowed markedly. The adjustment was deliberate and severe, and its
effects spread quickly through interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The
resulting recession was painful and reflected the monetary constraint required
to restore price stability; the tax reforms were only beginning to influence
behavior during this period.</span> </p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This timing
left monetary discipline operating without the offsetting fiscal expansion
prescribed by the Robert Mundell framework. Indexing had not yet begun, and
most marginal rate relief would not materialize until 1983. While
counterfactuals must be framed cautiously, earlier and more complete rate
reductions—combined with contemporaneous indexation—could plausibly have
softened the downturn by strengthening labor supply and investment incentives
at the outset of the tightening cycle. As implemented, the monetary contraction
operated against a still-unreformed tax structure, with the full ERTA phase-in not
yet in effect. This sequencing mirrors earlier reform episodes. As with the
Revenue Act of 1964, reductions in individual tax rates trailed declines in
business tax liabilities by several years. Firms thus faced improved incentives
for production and investment before households experienced meaningful relief.
The individual taxpayer—the ultimate consumer of goods and securities produced
by business—remained constrained by high marginal rates and inflation-driven
bracket effects during the early recovery phase. Table 22 reports the statutory
individual rate changes as scheduled to take effect by mid-1983.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The United
States entered a severe recession beginning in July 1981 that lasted through
November 1982. This was not a routine contraction; unemployment approached 11
percent, and interest-sensitive sectors such as manufacturing, construction,
and autos were hit particularly hard. Public frustration mounted, and members
of Congress increasingly demanded a change in policy direction. Yet the Federal
Reserve, committed to breaking inflation, held firmly to its restrictive
stance, and the Reagan administration did not attempt to interfere with
monetary policy or abandon its fiscal strategy. As conditions worsened,
political patience eroded. Many legislators had been skeptical of ERTA from the
outset, and the tax cuts became a convenient explanation for the downturn—even
though the recession was driven overwhelmingly by the monetary tightening necessary
to reverse a decade of inflation. Mounting pressure in Washington set the stage
for “corrective” legislation.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In September
1982, Congress enacted the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA),
often described at the time—based on Joint Committee static scores—as the
largest peacetime tax increase in U.S. history. This characterization rested on
projected rather than realized revenue effects and has frequently been
misinterpreted as a reversal of the 1981 tax reforms. In practice, </span><em><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;font-style:normal'>the act</span></em><i><span
> </span></i><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>left ERTA’s marginal rate reductions and forthcoming
indexing provisions entirely intact. Its changes fell primarily on depreciation
rules, the investment tax credit, certain business deductions, and a set of
excise tax and compliance provisions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The Joint
Committee estimated sizable revenue gains on a static basis, but the data tell
a different story. As Table 29.1 will show, corporate receipts continued to
decline in the recession’s aftermath, excise tax revenues fell in every year
following enactment, and aggregate federal receipts in 1983 and 1984 remained
suppressed by disinflation that restrained nominal income growth. TEFRA was
therefore not a repudiation of ERTA’s rate structure but a mid-recession
attempt to narrow projected deficits through base adjustments—an attempt whose
actual revenue impact was modest relative to the far larger macroeconomic
forces shaping fiscal totals.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Criticism of
Reagan’s program was intense even before ERTA’s passage. Walter Heller rejected
the idea that large marginal rate reductions would meaningfully expand output
through supply-side channels. In his assessment:</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in'><span
>Nothing in the history of tax cuts,
econometric studies, studies of taxpayer responses, or field surveys of
incentives suggests that the effects of a big tax cut on the supply of output
even begin to match its effect on demand for output. A $114 billion tax cut…
would simply overwhelm our existing productive capacity with a tidal wave of
increased demand and sweep away all hopes of curbing deficits and containing
inflation.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>66</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Such warnings
reflected the prevailing Keynesian view that large tax reductions would
stimulate demand far more than supply. Yet the sequence that unfolded—steep
disinflation first, followed by recovery alongside the phased-in rate
reductions—offered a revealing contrast between theoretical expectations and
observable outcomes. Sustained marginal rate cuts influence both sides of the
economy: they raise incentives to work, save, and invest through higher
after-tax returns, which in turn can support demand. ERTA, once fully phased
in, delivered a permanent change in marginal rates rather than a temporary
fiscal stimulus. The relevant question, therefore, is not whether tax cuts
influence supply or demand, but how the balance of behavioral responses evolves
over time. As the subsequent data show, labor supply, reported income, and
capital formation all rose meaningfully as rates declined—results inconsistent
with the prediction that supply responses would be negligible.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Concerns
about rising deficits persisted after ERTA’s passage, and federal red ink did
widen in the early 1980s. But deficits reflect both sides of the fiscal ledger.
It is accurate to note that the tax reductions did not produce lower federal
debt, yet it is equally necessary to account for spending growth and the
effects of recession and disinflation on nominal tax bases. Much of the fiscal
imbalance stemmed from the rise in outlays rather than a simple shortfall in
revenues. Since 1960, the federal government has recorded budget surpluses in
only six fiscal years—1960, 1969, and the four consecutive years from 1998
through 2001. This rarity underscores a persistent structural tendency for
federal expenditures to outpace revenues across administrations and economic
cycles, regardless of the prevailing tax regime. Even under static assumptions,
higher pre-ERTA marginal rates could not have erased the fiscal gap; the scale
of spending growth and the recession-driven contraction of nominal tax bases
made that highly implausible within any possible rate structure. Table 23 shows
total federal receipts and outlays across President Reagan’s two terms,
illustrating the interaction between tax policy, spending decisions, and
deficit outcomes.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A review of
real revenues shows that inflation-adjusted federal receipts were higher in
1981–82 than in 1980; a sustained real decline does not appear until 1983. This
timing reflects the interaction of ERTA’s phased-in rate reductions, delayed
bracket indexation, and the disinflationary collapse of nominal income growth.
Through 1981 and into 1982, receipts remained elevated because the legacy of
1970s inflation continued to push tax units into higher nominal brackets even
as statutory rates began to fall. Once disinflation took hold in mid-1982,
nominal income growth slowed sharply and the inflation-driven support to
revenues disappeared. The result was a delayed adjustment: revenues held up
through 1982 and then fell in real terms in 1983 as recession, slower nominal
income growth following disinflation, and the cumulative effect of ERTA’s rate
reductions took hold. With stabilization and the full rate and indexation
framework in place, revenue growth subsequently resumed alongside sustained
real expansion.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By contrast,
in the 1970s, rising inflation pushed tax units into higher nominal brackets,
inflating revenues in ways that outpaced underlying real income gains. Several
years—such as 1978 and 1979—recorded solid headline GDP growth, but these
figures masked deepening structural weakness: real wages stagnated, productivity
growth slowed, and inflation steadily eroded purchasing power. These pressures
culminated in the steep 1980 downturn, with real GDP contracting and
unemployment rising materially. The surge in federal receipts during this
period primarily reflected bracket creep rather than genuine improvements in
real economic performance.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Revenue, as
a share of GDP, averaged roughly 18.6 percent from 1979 to 1982—among the
highest peacetime levels of the postwar era. If national prosperity were
measured simply by the volume of federal receipts, then bracket creep might
appear desirable. But this conflates fiscal arithmetic with economic welfare.
The elevated revenue share reflected a transfer of purchasing power from the
private sector to the federal government during a period of pronounced monetary
and real-economy stress. Economic well-being is better measured by national
income than by the volume of tax collections.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This premise
is sharpened by Martin Feldstein’s observation in a 2010 survey of economists:
revenue maximization is the wrong criterion for evaluating tax policy. Asked
what tax rate would yield the most federal revenue, he replied: “Why look for
the rate that maximizes revenue? As the tax rate rises, the ‘deadweight loss’
(real loss to the economy) rises, so as the rate gets close to maximizing
revenue the loss to the economy exceeds the gain in revenue…. I dislike budget
deficits as much as anyone else. But would I really want to give up, say, $1
billion of GDP in order to reduce the deficit by $100 million? No. National
income is a goal in itself. That is what drives consumption and our standard of
living.” <a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>67</span></a>  Feldstein’s statement reinforces the general
point; tax policy should aim to expand real income and productive capacity, not
simply the government’s ability to tax the economy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
directly contradicts one of the most persistent distortions in treatments of
supply-side economics. Critics routinely treat revenue yield as the measure of
success, as if the objective were to identify the peak of the Laffer curve or
to “pay for” rate reductions through higher collections. But revenue
maximization has never been a tenet of supply-side theory. That framing
substitutes a fiscal scorecard for the actual mechanism at issue—the behavioral
and incentive-driven changes in work, saving, investment, and reported income that
arise when marginal tax rates are reduced. Evaluating supply-side policy
through the lens of government receipts alone not only misstates the theory; it
obscures the economic responses such policies are designed to elicit. Across
the major historical episodes examined here, marginal rate reductions were
justified on different grounds and in different vocabularies, but they shared a
common emphasis on incentives, output, and income reporting rather than on
revenue maximization. In these varied cases, revenues eventually rose as
marginal rates fell, with the largest gains coming from high earners. Those
increases, however, were treated as contingent outcomes of stronger incentives
and higher reported income—not as the primary objective of the reforms.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Moreover,
the timing of ERTA’s implementation created predictable behavioral responses.
Economic actors adjust decisions based on expected after-tax returns, and
during periods of scheduled reform, high-income individuals with flexibility
had incentives to adjust the timing of realizations as the new rate structure
took effect. The data reflect this pattern: the number of tax units reporting
incomes above $100,000 rose sharply as the post-reform regime stabilized,
consistent with deferral and timing behavior rather than an immediate expansion
or collapse of taxable capacity. A similar anticipatory response followed the
Revenue Act of 1964, when taxpayers adjusted the timing of reported income in
advance of scheduled rate reductions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By late
1982, the Federal Reserve had moved away from strict M1 targeting—central to
the 1979 monetarist experiment—in favor of a more discretionary framework that
relied on a broader set of indicators, including commodity prices, credit
conditions, and interest-rate movements. Monetary historians describe this
shift as replacing rigid M1 “target ranges” with monitoring ranges, reflecting
diminished confidence in any single aggregate as a reliable policy guide. In
this context, </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span style='font-family:
"Aptos",sans-serif'>Arthur Laffer and Charles Kadlec</span></span><span
> maintained that a “price rule for
monetary policy—the final precondition for the roaring ’80s—is being put into
place.” <a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>68</span></a>  Viewed alongside ERTA’s
incentive-oriented reforms, the transition toward a more stable nominal
environment resembled the fiscal–monetary mix long emphasized by </span><span
class=whitespace-normal><span >Robert
Mundell</span></span><span >: sound monetary
policy paired with lower marginal tax rates to support long-run growth.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Inflation
had declined to roughly 5 percent by the fall of 1982, and the stock market
began to rebound strongly after its August trough, yet unemployment remained
above 10 percent. Public frustration reflected the difficult transition period;
in late January 1983, Gallup recorded the lowest approval rating of Reagan’s
presidency at 35 percent, with disapproval at 56 percent, a measure of how
little of the turnaround had yet registered publicly.<a href="#_ftn69"
name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>69</span></a> But
this trough marked the inflection point. Economic conditions soon began to
improve as disinflation took hold, interest rates fell, and the phased-in ERTA
provisions moved toward full effect, coinciding with the expansion that
followed.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The final
stage of the ERTA rate reductions took effect in July 1983, completing the
phased-in portion of the reform. By that point, inflation had fallen below 4
percent following the Federal Reserve policy shifts. With monetary restraint
established and the major elements of incentive-oriented tax policy in place,
the economic environment changed materially. Beginning in late 1982 and
continuing through 1983 and beyond, output accelerated, unemployment began a sustained
decline, inflation remained contained, and federal revenues eventually rose as
real activity expanded. The result was one of the most durable peacetime
expansions in modern U.S. history, extending through the late 1980s before
giving way to the brief 1990–91 recession.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Every
administration confronts conditions specific to its time; policy does not
unfold in a vacuum. The early 1980s involved unusually difficult trade-offs,
with persistent stagflation and eroding public confidence leaving no option
that promised immediate economic relief. Inflation was ultimately arrested
through sustained monetary restraint, followed by recession and recovery. A
sharp decline in oil prices in the mid-1980s later reinforced the expansion but
it did not initiate it; policymakers neither controlled the timing nor the
sequence of these shocks.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Concerns
about inflation following major tax reductions were not limited to the CBO or Walter
Heller; they reflected a longstanding belief that expansionary fiscal policy
risked exceeding productive capacity. The subsequent record did not align with
those expectations. Inflation declined sharply after 1980, while unemployment
began a sustained fall after 1982, even as real GDP expanded strongly. As shown
in Table 24, disinflation coincided with recovery rather than renewed price
pressures. The episode reinforced a lesson evident in earlier periods examined
here: the relationship between inflation and unemployment is not stable across
policy regimes, and improved supply incentives can coexist with disinflation
when monetary discipline is credible.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By the end
of Reagan’s first term the economy had entered a strong recovery, coinciding
with the combined effects of tax reform and sustained monetary disinflation.
With stability established and wide recognition that the income tax still
contained deep structural distortions, the policy focus shifted toward
comprehensive base reform. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86) paired this
agenda with further rate compression, while eliminating or tightening many
long-standing preferences—making it the most far-reaching structural reform of
the federal income tax since its modern inception. Following conference
reconciliation in October 1986, the legislation cleared Congress with
overwhelming bipartisan support (House 292–136; Senate 74–23), demonstrating
the durability of base-broadening rate reduction as a shared legislative
objective.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>71</span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Because the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 fundamentally rewired the structure of the income tax, a
brief accounting of its mechanics is necessary before turning to its empirical
effects. Although the act sharply reduced marginal rates, it was engineered to
be revenue neutral under conventional static scoring assumptions. Its broad
bipartisan support reflected a shared view that rate reduction and base
broadening operated within the same incentive tradition associated with the
Kennedy reforms, amid growing frustration with deductions, shelters, and
special-interest carve-outs. TRA-86 addressed the problem by restructuring the
incentive framework. The code shed preferences and closed shelters, and in
exchange compressed the rate schedule. With the payoff to avoidance reduced and
the statutory structure simplified, neutrality improved, compliance costs fell,
and the system’s credibility strengthened.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >For decades
the tax code had sprawled across more than two dozen brackets. The early 1980s
compression had reduced that number to fourteen, but TRA-86 went much further; it
collapsed the architecture to five brackets in 1987 with a phased-in reduction
of marginal rates. By 1988, the rate structure had been compressed to two
statutory brackets: taxable income above $29,750 faced a 28 percent marginal
rate, while income below that threshold was taxed at 15 percent. A 5 percent
phase-out surtax, however, created an effective 33 percent marginal rate within
a limited upper-income band as the benefit of the 15 percent bracket was
recaptured. Standard deductions and personal exemptions were expanded and
indexed thereafter. On paper, this amounted to a 22-point reduction in the top statutory
rate relative to the pre-TRA-86 regime and a modest nominal increase at the
bottom. But the distributional picture requires the full mechanics. Although
the lowest statutory rate rose from the 11–14 percent range to 15 percent, the
enlarged deduction and exemption thresholds lightened the burden on low-income
tax units.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Across the
income distribution, representative filing scenarios show materially lower
liabilities under TRA-86 than under prior law. Table 25 makes the point
directly. For married couples with no dependents using the standard deduction
and personal exemptions, tax owed falls in each of the illustrated income
ranges, with the largest dollar reductions appearing in the middle of the
distribution. This pattern indicates that the reform shifted the tax burden
upward. The combination of expanded base exemptions and compressed statutory
rates reduced liability for typical filers across a wide span of incomes.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >President
Reagan outlined the aims of tax reform in a national radio address on May 25,
1985. He argued that the long erosion of the personal exemption had imposed a
hidden tax increase on ordinary families and stressed that reform must deliver
direct relief to low- and middle-income earners. Expanding the personal
exemption, raising the standard deduction, and lowering rates, he said, would
make it easier for working households—especially those at the lower end of the
income scale—to gain ground. Simplification and the curbing of shelters were
integral to that effort.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Reagan also
addressed the frustration driving demand for change. Americans were willing to
pay taxes, he noted, but resented a system that left typical workers facing
high rates while those with resources and advisers could legally avoid them.
The code’s complexity, he warned, had damaged the economy, burdened ordinary
filers, and undermined confidence in government.<a href="#_ftn72"

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Consistent
with earlier revenue acts, TRA-86 made sweeping changes beyond reducing
individual rates. Evaluating their effects requires examining the statutes’
specific provisions and empirical record. Viewed as a whole, the act
substantially increased the zero-tax threshold by enlarging personal exemptions
and the standard deduction, while also lowering marginal rates across most
income levels. The combined effects are reflected in post-implementation data
showing meaningful reductions in tax burdens for lower- and middle-income
households.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In addition
to rate compression and increased exemptions, TRA-86 eliminated many of the
tax-shelter mechanisms prevalent in prior decades. Limitations on passive
losses, repeal of the investment tax credit, slower depreciation schedules, and
expansion of the Alternative Minimum Tax significantly reduced opportunities to
shield income, reinforcing the relative incentive to earn and report income
rather than shelter it.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The act also
instituted substantial changes affecting tax units at different points in the
income distribution. The standard deduction and personal exemptions, essentially
stagnant since 1979, were substantially increased. As noted earlier in the
Depression-era discussion, the personal exemption’s nominal value rose above
its pre–New Deal peak for the first time since 1931, with the increase taking
effect fully by 1988. The exemption was also phased out at higher income
levels, ensuring that the largest relative gain accrued to low- and
middle-income households. These reforms represented a structural shift:
deductions and exemptions were raised, indexed thereafter for inflation, and
arranged in a way that lifted the tax threshold for lower-income families while
preventing bracket creep from eroding relief over time.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), also established under TRA-86, became
the central federal mechanism for supporting the development of affordable
rental housing and remains so today. Although the rate reductions receive most
of the historical attention, the distributional mechanics and base-broadening
changes were equally significant. Together, these measures produced tangible
gains for low- and middle-income tax units. In the following section, IRS
Statistics of Income data provide an empirical account of how reported income,
tax liabilities, and taxpayer behavior evolved in the wake of the 1980s
reforms.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As covered
previously, real individual income tax receipts softened in 1983-84. This
reflected the transition from high inflation to disinflation and the lingering
effects of the double-dip recession, not a contraction of the tax base.
Disinflation slowed nominal income growth, while the downturn depressed profits
and capital income realizations, removing the inflation-driven revenue effects
that had characterized the prior decade. Although critics attributed the
temporary decline to the tax cuts themselves, the timing of receipts across
income categories and the simultaneous fall in inflation indicate that
recession and disinflation were the dominant drivers of the decline, rather
than changes in marginal rates.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Once the
phased-in reductions and indexation had taken full effect, following the
achievement of monetary stabilization, the economy and revenues rebounded strongly.</span>
<span >Real output expanded substantially
through 1984, marking the end of stagflation and the beginning of one of the
strongest sustained expansions of the postwar era—an outcome inconsistent with
static predictions about tax-policy effects. The relevant question is not
whether revenues dipped during the transition but whether the long-run effects
of lower marginal rates aligned with observed behavior and economic
performance.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Rising
nominal revenue following ERTA’s enactment can be cited as evidence that revenues
increased after the tax cuts. While that inference is defensible in narrow
terms, it obscures the timing, interactions, and real-dollar dynamics that
shaped fiscal outcomes during the period. As Table 26.1 shows, real individual
income tax receipts increased in the two years following ERTA’s implementation
despite the recession. Crucially, effective tax burdens did not fall
immediately; bracket creep persisted, and statutory indexing did not begin
until 1985. As a result, average effective rates rose for many tax units even
as marginal rates were being reduced, producing higher receipts before real
revenues dipped at the recession’s trough and in its immediate aftermath.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As the
recovery took hold and incentives for sheltering and deferral diminished,
reported income increased, and a larger share of economic activity moved into
the individual tax base. These developments align with empirical findings on
the elasticity of taxable income and with the pronounced shift toward wage,
pass-through, and capital income reporting over the decade. Although base
broadening under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and changes in organizational form
also contributed, the real-dollar revenue pattern is more consistent with
incentive-driven responses and transitional effects than with static
projections of persistent revenue loss.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Corporate
income tax receipts rose considerably between 1986 and 1988, even as the top
corporate rate fell from 46 percent to 34 percent under TRA-86. To understand
this pattern, it is important to identify why corporate receipts had been
unusually high in 1980 and, to a lesser extent, in 1981. In addition to
double-digit inflation, the top individual rate remained at 70 percent,
creating strong incentives for high-income tax units to defer or recharacterize
income through the corporate form. Evidence from retention behavior,
organizational choice, and reported income patterns indicates that closely held
C-corporations increasingly functioned not only as operating entities but as
tax-advantaged repositories for income that would otherwise have faced much
higher individual rates. As individual and corporate rates converged in the
mid-1980s, this arbitrage narrowed substantially. Concurrently, ERTA
accelerated depreciation rules and front-loaded deductions precisely when
profits were weakest, mechanically depressing corporate receipts in 1982 and
1983. TRA-86 further deepened the corporate base by repealing the investment
tax credit, slowing depreciation, restricting passive losses, and expanding the
AMT. Even as narrower rate differentials encouraged pass-through status and curtailed
many corporate shelter opportunities, the strengthening economy expanded
taxable corporate income, resulting in higher corporate receipts despite
markedly lower statutory rates.</span></p>

<h2 id="behavioral-and-distributional-effects-of-the-1981-and-1986-reforms">Behavioral and Distributional Effects of the 1981 and 1986 Reforms</h2>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The 1980s
provide the most consequential test of incentive-based tax policy since the
Kennedy reforms of 1964 and the most extensive restructuring of the federal
income tax since the Mellon era of the 1920s. Through the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986, marginal rates fell sharply,
brackets compressed, and long-standing shelters were curtailed or eliminated.
The empirical questions follow directly: how did taxpayers adjust to lower
marginal rates and a restructured code, and how did reported income and federal
receipts evolve across income groups?</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As the data
show, the responses to the major rate changes of the 1980s align with the
patterns observed after the Mellon and Kennedy reforms: shifts in reported
income, reductions in avoidance, and changes in the composition and level of
federal revenue that reflect behavioral adjustment rather than static
projections. Lower marginal rates, combined with an expanded base, shifted the
income tax burden away from lower-income earners and toward higher-income tax
units. In the 1980s, this effect was reinforced by reforms that preserved real
incomes at the lower end of the distribution through higher statutory
exemptions and standard deductions, with indexing playing a critical role. Across
the decade, tax units earning under $10,000—largely representing individuals at
the early stages of the income ladder, given an average wage index of roughly
$16,000—bore a smaller share of the income tax burden even as real receipts
increased.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73"
title="">73</a></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Economic
expansion, falling unemployment, and moderating inflation amplified these
effects. Consistent with the behavioral response framework developed throughout
this analysis, improvements in the incentives to work, invest, and report
income broadened the taxable base. Rising revenues often occurred as a
secondary consequence, though not the objective, of the policy. As Tables 27–29
show, the distributional shifts of the 1980s contrast sharply with those of the
Great Depression and the ensuing decades, when the burden increasingly moved
onto lower- and middle-income tax units.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The U.S.
population increased by roughly 18 million between 1980 and 1988, yet the
number of tax returns reporting incomes below $10,000 declined by an average of
about 4.5 million per year over the same period. These figures also exclude
transfer payments and employer-provided benefits, which constituted a growing
share of resources for households at the lower end of the distribution. Viewed
alongside expanded personal exemptions, indexing, rising real earnings,
enhanced employer provided benefits, and increased transfer-payment support,
the decline in low-income filings does not indicate falling real income among
lower-earning households. Rather, consistent with the upward shifts observed
after the Revenue Act of 1964, a substantial portion of tax units who had been
in this range appear to have moved into higher brackets as real incomes
increased.</span></p>

the number of returns reporting incomes above $100,000 increased by roughly 2

revenues from higher-income tax units rose substantially during a period in

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Throughout this
period, the most affluent tax units accounted for a substantially larger share
of federal income tax revenues, while the share borne by lower-income filers
declined, with the largest reduction among those reporting under $10,000 in
income. These shifts did not arise from a redistribution of income toward the
top at the expense of others; rather, they coincided with general income
growth, increased movement into higher income brackets, and a marked
contraction in the number of returns at the lowest income levels. As in the periods
following the Mellon and Kennedy cuts, reductions in top marginal rates during
the 1980s were accompanied by more filers reporting higher incomes, greater
revenue contributions from upper-income tax units, and expanding economic
activity across the distribution. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >While
reported top incomes expanded aggressively during this span, a significant
portion of that growth reflected realizations of capital gains. It is important
to note that a realized capital gain, by itself, does not make a taxpayer
wealthier in any substantive economic sense. It simply converts one
asset—equity, real estate, or another capital holding—into another form, cash.
The individual’s net worth does not increase by selling the asset but only
changes composition. Yet because realizations are recorded as income in the
year they occur, they enter IRS data as spikes in reported income even though
no new wealth has been created, only reclassified. For this reason, changes in
capital gains realizations often reveal timing responses to tax incentives
rather than genuine increases in underlying economic inequality.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Figure 4
places these effects in sharp relief. Capital gains realizations climbed
steadily after 1981 as equity values recovered and as lower effective marginal
rates made the recognition of gains less costly. But the most dramatic movement
occurred in 1986, when taxpayers anticipated the statutory increase in the
capital gains rate from 20 to 28 percent that would take effect on January 1,
1987. The result was an unprecedented surge in realizations in the final year
of the lower rate, followed immediately by a collapse in 1987 once the higher
rate applied. The pattern of a one-year increase of that magnitude followed by an
immediate retrenchment of equal force is entirely consistent with a tax-induced
shifting of realizations across years.</span></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The jump in
1986 does not reflect a sudden improvement in top-end economic conditions nor a
worsening of the distribution for lower- or middle-income tax units. Instead,
it reveals how taxpayers with appreciable capital holdings deliberately adjust
the timing of transactions when rate changes are known in advance. After the
statutory rate rose in 1987, realizations fell back to levels more closely
aligned with long-run behavior, confirming that the earlier spike was a
temporary reporting response rather than a durable structural shift. A one-year
surge in income produced by a realization also does not imply that the same tax
unit will report similar income again in subsequent years, and such tables
should not be interpreted as evidence of persistent identity within brackets.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
dynamics are critical for interpreting the wider distributional patterns. To
the extent that rising top-end shares in the mid-1980s were driven by the
bunching of capital gains realizations, many of which were the culmination of
long-term asset accumulation rather than new income, they cannot be taken as
evidence of a deterioration in the position of lower-income filers. The
distributional data for 1986 and 1987 are incredibly sensitive to the capital gains
provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and assessments of inequality trends
that treat these years as representative without adjusting for realization
behavior risks overstating the degree of underlying change. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Moreover,
this is just one of several factors that exaggerate the apparent widening of
inequality in pretax IRS data. The mid-1980s coincided with multiple,
overlapping shifts: the reclassification of business income onto individual
returns as partnerships and S corporations expanded; changes in AGI definitions
under the Tax Reform Act of 1986; the consolidation of previously sheltered
income as preferences were curtailed; and the migration of professional and
closely held firms into pass-through form in anticipation of lower individual
rates. As a result, business income’s share of adjusted gross income for the
top 1 percent increased from approximately 7.8 percent in 1981 to about 21.2
percent in 1988.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>74</span></a> This change reflects income being
reported in a different form and location within the tax system and does not
necessarily imply a commensurate increase in underlying income.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Each of
these developments increased the flow of income reported at the top without
requiring any deterioration in the condition of lower-income filers. Nor do
they necessarily reflect greater concentration of economic resources. They
simply altered where income appeared on tax returns. At the same time, the
pretax income recorded for lower-income filers excludes a growing share of
non-taxable resources—transfer payments, employer-provided benefits, and
expanding retirement vehicles—that do not enter AGI but materially support
living standards. The result is that the measured distribution in IRS data can
widen from both directions: the top appears higher because more income is
routed onto individual returns, while the lower end appears flatter because
significant components of economic resources never reach the tax base at all. Bureau
of Economic Analysis data illustrate the magnitude of this change: real
transfer payments rose by $19.2 billion between 1981 and 1989, a 256 percent
increase.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75"
title="">75</a></span>  By contrast, from 1973 to 1980 real transfers increased
by $4.2 billion.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The combined
effect is a statistical magnification of top-end income shares at precisely the
moment when structural reforms were reshaping the tax base. When realizations
bunch in response to scheduled rate changes, business income shifts from the
corporate to the individual sector, and formerly untaxed or lightly taxed
components of income enter AGI, the resulting distributional picture captures
changes in reporting conventions at least as much as it captures changes in
underlying economic reality. Any interpretation of the period that does not
adjust for these mechanical influences risks attributing to inequality what is
more plausibly explained by the interaction of incentives, reclassification,
and tax-base expansion. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The general
point is straightforward. The 1981 and 1986 reforms altered both incentives and
definitions. Taxpayer responses to marginal rates are visible in earned income,
but they are even more pronounced in capital gains realizations because
taxpayers can decide when, within wide bounds, to recognize gains for tax
purposes. The observed movements in capital gains income during the 1980s
illustrate a core theme of this study: tax-policy changes shape the timing and
volume of reported income more than they align with independent economic
conditions. Ignoring the role of realizations converts temporary timing
behavior into misleading narratives of long-run inequality. As the capital gains
data show, realizations again surged in the late 1990s, reflecting repeated
timing responses to changing tax incentives.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Furthermore,
movements in tax burden shares need not mirror movements in the pretax income
distribution. If pretax incomes become more equal, the share of taxes paid by
higher-income filers will fall mechanically, and the share paid by lower-income
filers will rise, even in the absence of any statutory change. Conversely, when
structural reforms expand the tax base at the top—through reclassification of
business income, the curtailment of preferences, or shifts in the timing of
realizations—tax-burden shares can rise even if underlying economic inequality
has not. Evaluating these shifts without reference to taxpayer behavior,
statutory adjustments, and reporting dynamics risks drawing conclusions that
the data themselves do not support. Contemporary analysts have recognized this
interaction for decades, noting that changes in measured progressivity often
reflect the evolving structure of the tax base rather than isolated changes in
economic conditions. The broader implications are taken up in the conclusion;
for present purposes, the point is narrower: the distributional outcomes of the
1980s reforms cannot be understood apart from the behavioral and definitional
changes that shaped the reported income on which those outcomes rest.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >For
illustration, consider a counterfactual in which marginal tax rates on top
incomes were set at 90 percent and every dollar of revenue collected from that
cohort—abstracting from behavioral responses—were redistributed in the form of
transfers to lower-income households. Under such a regime, the distribution of </span><strong><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;font-weight:normal'>pretax, pretransfer
income</span></strong><span > would
appear unchanged, because the underlying data record only incomes before taxes
and transfers are applied. The statistical picture would therefore be
identical, even under complete and perfectly targeted redistribution.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This
highlights a fundamental limitation of tax return–based inequality measures: </span><strong><span
style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;font-weight:normal'>the analytical tool
is mismatched to the question being asked.</span></strong><span
> A precise metric can nonetheless be an
inappropriate one. For example, an individual changing their diet may gain or
lose substantial body weight, yet a thermometer used to quantify such changes
will continue to register readings around 98.6 degrees. Equally, large changes
in redistribution can occur without producing corresponding changes in pretax
income distributions. Instruments designed to measure one variable cannot be
repurposed to evaluate another. When applied beyond their domain, such metrics
offer little guidance for policy design. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Returning to
the analysis of Reagan-era policy, ERTA did not achieve all of its stated
fiscal objectives. The administration’s projected revenue gains and
deficit-reduction paths did not fully materialize—owing partly to optimistic
baseline assumptions and partly to the interaction of the slow phase-in of the
tax cuts, monetary tightening, recession dynamics, and later fiscal decisions
that diverged from the original program. Yet shortfalls relative to projections
differ materially from a continual macroeconomic deterioration. The early-1980s
recession, which predated the full implementation of ERTA, was followed by
sustained declines in inflation, steady year-over-year reductions in
unemployment after 1982, and strong growth in real GDP and real income per
capita. These developments indicate that the economy rebounded strongly from
the high-inflation, unstable growth environment of the prior decade and entered
a prolonged expansion.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As shown
earlier, federal tax receipts rose substantially in real terms over the latter
half of the decade, though not nearly enough to keep pace with federal
spending—a pattern consistent with the postwar era generally. Table 30 shows
that federal receipts as a share of GDP during the Reagan years exceeded those
of every administration since Truman except Carter’s. The Carter-era peak,
however, was driven by severe bracket creep under high inflation, whereas by
late 1982 inflation had fallen to roughly 5 percent and income tax brackets
were indexed beginning in 1985. Real GDP growth during the 1980s was also
historically strong. Although federal debt rose substantially over the decade,
the evidence does not support attributing that increase to marginal rate
reductions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Treasury
estimates summarized by Jerry Tempalski indicate that ERTA reduced federal
revenues by an average of 2.89 percent of GDP over its first four years.<a
href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>76</span></a>
At that estimated level, revenues as a share of GDP would have exceeded any
peacetime four-year period to date and approached the wartime revenue levels
recorded during World War II. The estimate is derived from conventional
Treasury revenue scoring, but the counterfactual revenue path it implies is not
fully specified. Even taken at face value, the counterfactual implied by the
estimate resembles the high-inflation, bracket-creep environment of the late
1970s rather than any stable baseline. The early 1980s were defined by
disinflation, the double-dip recession, and major changes in reporting
incentives—all of which complicate static comparisons between projected and
realized revenue paths. Tempalski’s estimate therefore cannot be treated as
evidence that ERTA’s revenue effects caused the subsequent fiscal deficits. The
inference runs backward; it presumes that revenues suppressed by disinflation
reflect a policy failure, rather than recognizing such outcomes as an expected
feature of restoring price stability and real growth.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Table 30
shows that federal receipts during the 1980s remained well within the postwar
norm, underscoring that the 1981 reforms did not produce an anomalous revenue
collapse. The reforms were not designed to maximize short-term receipts, but to
realign marginal incentives, widen the tax base, and improve long-run economic
performance. In real terms, revenues dipped briefly during the early recovery,
then rose steadily as growth resumed, bracket indexation reduced
inflation-driven distortions, and reported income increased. More directly to
the present inquiry, the individual income tax under Reagan generated roughly
8.2 percent of a substantially larger GDP, compared with 8.25 percent under
Carter and sub-8 percent averages throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Outlays, by
contrast, averaged 21.82 percent of GDP, driven by the defense buildup, the
fiscal effects of disinflation, and the rigidity of preexisting mandatory
spending commitments. The resulting deficits stemmed primarily from expenditure
levels rather than a deterioration in revenue capacity. Over the same period,
real GDP expanded by more than $2.2 trillion—the largest increase recorded by
any postwar administration up to that point—highlighting the need to evaluate
fiscal and economic outcomes together rather than rely on forecast variances or
static revenue expectations.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These fiscal
dynamics unfolded within a broader geopolitical environment that shaped budget
priorities and policy tradeoffs. The Cold War remained the dominant national security
priority, and policymakers in both parties regarded the Soviet Union as a
strategic threat. The defense buildup of the early and mid-1980s, supported on
a bipartisan basis, consisted largely of long-lived capital investments rather
than short-run consumption. These outlays lifted federal spending as a share of
GDP and should be distinguished from domestic discretionary increases or the
entitlement growth embedded in earlier legislation. The peaceful resolution of
the Cold War and the subsequent rapid success of U.S. forces in the Gulf War
frame the strategic context in which these fiscal choices were made, even
though the counterfactual cannot be observed. Any evaluation of the decade’s
budgetary record must therefore consider both economic policy and the security
imperatives shaping federal spending. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >To contextualize
the scale of defense outlays, it is useful to compare the Reagan buildup with
Cold War spending in the early 1960s. Although average annual defense spending
in real dollars was higher during 1981–1988 than in the pre-Vietnam Cold War
years, the fiscal burden was materially lighter. Measured against total output,
defense outlays absorbed approximately 7.5 percent of GDP from 1962 to 1966,
compared with 5.5 percent over 1981–1988—a reduction of roughly 25 percent.<a
href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>77</span></a>
This indicates that military spending in the 1980s was not unprecedented and
cannot alone account for the decade’s debt dynamics.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Beyond the
defense buildup and preexisting, non-discretionary commitments at the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration,
most departments experienced only modest expenditure growth. The principal
exception was the Treasury, driven by forces discussed earlier. Most notably,
the successful reduction of inflation sharply weakened bracket creep,
eliminating a major source of automatic revenue growth that had characterized
the 1970s.</span> <span >Second, debt
accumulated during the high-inflation years now had to be serviced in a lower-inflation
environment with historically high interest rates, raising the real cost of
interest payments. These fiscal dynamics contributed to the early-1980s
deficits and are often attributed to steep revenue losses following the tax
cuts. The spending data, however, indicate that entitlement growth and rising
interest burdens played central roles. Accounting for these factors is
essential to evaluating the fiscal record of the 1980s in proper context. Table
31 demonstrates the agency level spending by major category.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Policy
development in the 1980s must also be situated within its institutional environment.
Throughout 1981–1989, partisan control of Congress was divided: Democrats held
the House for the entire period, and the Senate shifted from Republican to
Democratic control after 1986. Under Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution,
revenue legislation originates in the House, and both the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 passed with bipartisan support.
Fiscal policy during the decade therefore reflected negotiated legislative
outcomes rather than unilateral executive action. The contrast between
contemporary voting coalitions and later narratives highlights how
retrospective accounts can diverge from both the legislative record and the
fiscal results of the period.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >With the
composition of federal spending now established, the rise in federal debt
during the 1980s can be properly contextualized. Revenues did not collapse in
response to rate reductions; spending, much of it driven by programs enacted
before 1981 and by ongoing defense commitments, expanded more rapidly than
receipts. Although the Reagan tax cuts were not solely responsible for the
economic recovery, the timing and subsequent performance of key indicators—real
GDP, unemployment, investment, and real tax receipts—align with the view that
lower marginal rates improved economic incentives and supported stronger
output. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
macroeconomic recovery of the 1980s reflected several forces operating at
once—monetary stabilization, demographic growth, and changes in the global
economic environment among them. These influences mattered, but the scale and
persistence of the expansion are difficult to reconcile with assertions that
marginal rate reductions played no meaningful role. Nor does the evidence
support the converse claims that the tax cuts were harmful or that rising
inequality stemmed primarily from lower statutory rates. Structural shifts in
the economy—technology adoption, globalization, the transition toward services,
skill-biased demand, and evolving compensation practices—shaped distributional
outcomes well beyond the reach of any single tax statute. Contemporary accounts
often obscure this complexity. Monetary tightening, phased-in rate reductions,
indexing, and shelter elimination all interacted during a turbulent decade, and
simplified interpretations cannot capture these dynamics. Yet three distinct historical
episodes—the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s—show a consistent pattern: when marginal
rates fall substantially and the base is broadened, reported income rises,
avoidance declines, and federal receipts from upper-income tax units increase. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Real median
income data illustrate this broader backdrop; despite nominal growth, living
standards stagnated through the late 1970s as inflation eroded real purchasing
power. A clear shift in trend becomes visible following the early-1980s
recession, with real income consistently rising thereafter. This inflection is
not attributable to tax cuts alone, but the timing aligns with the restoration
of productive incentives, monetary stability and the removal of the
bracket-creep mechanism. Figure 5 illustrates this transition directly: the
lived economic conditions of ordinary Americans improved in the 1980s after a
decade in which real gains had been largely wiped out by inflation and bracket
creep.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Economic
policy does not operate in isolation, and some of the favorable conditions that
shaped the 1980s expansion did not emerge overnight. Several important reforms
and institutional shifts predated the Reagan program, including the Broadhead Amendment’s
1978 reduction in the capital gains rate, Carter-era deregulation in
transportation, communications, and energy, and the onset of Paul Volcker’s
disinflation campaign. All occurred before the Reagan tax reforms and proved
indispensable to the decade’s economic performance. At the same time, the
Reagan years were not without setbacks: the deep early recession, the 1987
market crash, the savings-and-loan crisis, and a sharp rise in federal debt.
These episodes reinforce that expansions rarely proceed uninterrupted; shocks
and reversals are inherent to every economic cycle. Recognizing the multiple
contributors to the decade’s gains does not diminish the importance of the
Reagan-era reforms but places them in proper context.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >When
evaluated within the historical arc traced throughout this study, the tax
reforms of the 1980s represent the most consequential test of incentive-based
policy since the Revenue Acts of the 1920s and 1960s. The reforms sharply
reduced marginal rates, eliminated long-standing shelters, expanded exemptions,
raised standard deductions, and compressed brackets. Incentives to work,
invest, and report income strengthened; avoidance strategies narrowed, and the
taxable base broadened. As the IRS data show, these behavioral responses help
explain the rise in reported income and the upward shift in tax payments among
higher-income filers. At the same time, lower statutory rates and indexing
preserved real incomes for ordinary workers and better aligned the tax code
with productive activity rather than avoidance.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The
interplay of forces during the Reagan era was complex, but the empirical
pattern is not. Across the major incentive-driven reforms of the twentieth
century—the Mellon, Kennedy, and Reagan programs—the response of taxpayers has
been consistent: higher reported incomes, strong revenue performance, and a
measurable shift in the tax burden away from lower-income households. The 1980s
complete that pattern and reinforce this study’s central finding: marginal tax
rates shape how income is earned and reported by influencing incentives to
work, invest, and produce. Revenue outcomes follow from these behavioral
responses—though the appropriate margin of analysis is the health of the
economy and the living standards it sustains, not the maximization of tax
receipts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >President George
H. W. Bush entered office pledging “no new taxes” but ultimately accepted the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, enacted under Democratic majorities
in both chambers. Effective in 1991, OBRA-90 raised the top marginal rate from
28 to 31 percent and introduced a new 28-percent bracket, while also increasing
selected excise and payroll taxes. These changes coincided with a mild
recession beginning in mid-1990, driven primarily by monetary tightening and
the oil-price shock associated with the Gulf War.</span> <span
>Relative to the major reforms of 1981
and 1986, OBRA-90 represented a modest upward adjustment to the rate schedule
rather than a structural redesign, but it established the statutory baseline
inherited by the Clinton administration.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >President Bill
Clinton was elected in 1992 following the brief recession in the early 1990s. At
the time, both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and
Budget projected persistent federal budget deficits extending through much of
the decade. Anyone familiar with the history of such forecasts understands
their limits. This is not a criticism of the CBO or OMB; it simply reflects the
difficulty of projecting economic conditions several years ahead, let alone
over a decade. Predicting the economic path of a nation, shaped by trillions of
decentralized decisions and innumerable contingencies, is inherently uncertain.
</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Amid
concerns over long-run fiscal imbalance, President Clinton signed the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The law raised the top personal marginal tax
rates to 36 percent for incomes above $140,000 and to 39.6 percent for incomes
above $250,000. The measure passed the House by a one-vote margin, 218–216 and
cleared the Senate only through Vice President Al Gore’s tie-breaking vote.<a
href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>78</span></a>
No Republican supported the bill. This narrow legislative outcome marked the
beginning of the modern partisan divide over the federal income tax. Examining
tax receipts shows that federal revenues rose during the Clinton presidency,
and advocates of higher taxes on upper-income earners often cite this period as
evidence that raising rates on the affluent reliably increases revenue. On the
surface, the 1990s appear to support that claim. In practice, however, other
forces exerted greater influence; the policy context differs materially from
earlier episodes examined in this study.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The top
statutory rate rose to 39.6 percent—an increase of 8.6 percentage points from
its prior level and 11.6 points above the 1988–1990 rate. Yet even after this
change, the top rate remained historically low by the standards of the modern
income tax. It was still 10.4 percentage points below the fully phased-in top
rate under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and 31.4 points lower than the
top rate following the Revenue Act of 1964. Since World War I, comparably low
top rates had existed only in the brief intervals of 1925–1931 and 1988–1992. Moreover,
the increase of 1993 bears little resemblance to the rate shocks of earlier
eras. Against that historical backdrop, the Clinton increase was modest. The general
economic environment—including rapid productivity growth, relatively restrained
federal spending, and exceptional gains in corporate profits and equity
valuations—played a more decisive role in shaping revenue performance than the
marginal rate adjustment alone. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >IRS data for
1992–94 show a familiar pattern: a pronounced rise in top wages ahead of the
1993 rate increase, followed by declines in 1993 and again in 1994. In real
terms, top salaries in 1994 remained below their 1988 level. These movements
are consistent with anticipatory income shifting ahead of the OBRA-93 rate
increase and with reduced reported income once higher marginal rates were in
place. Although OBRA-93 produced measurable avoidance behavior—most clearly in
the surge of top wages in 1992—the scale of the response was smaller than in
earlier episodes of large rate increases. These dynamics are demonstrated in
Table 32.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Reported
activity accelerated in the latter half of the decade, but it does not follow
that the late-1990s influx of top-end reported income can be attributed to
higher marginal rates. IRS and BEA data instead show that the tax base narrowed
substantially in the years surrounding the 1993 rate increase. Between 1988 and
1994, adjusted gross income declined from roughly 90 percent of national
personal income to about 86.6 percent.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>79</span></a> Over the same period,
taxable income—AGI net of exemptions and deductions—fell from nearly 50 percent
of personal income to approximately 44.5 percent.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Much of the eventual
increase reflected extraordinary and non-repeatable conditions: a
technology-driven equity boom, widespread stock-option exercises, and a strong
dollar that supported capital inflows and elevated asset valuations. Reported
income and receipts rose abruptly after the 1997 reduction in the capital gains
rate, not following the 1993 rate increase. These episodic forces, rather than
higher statutory rates, explain the late-decade acceleration in reported income
and tax receipts among top earning tax units. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Following
the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, business income as a share of
top-decile income rose markedly, averaging roughly 26 percent of reported
income among apex earners across Clinton’s presidency.<a href="#_ftn80"
name="_ftnref80" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>80</span></a> This
shift reflects changes in the form in which income was reported rather than a
commensurate expansion of underlying economic activity. Routing income through
business forms expanded opportunities for recharacterization, deferral, and
deduction, lowering effective tax burdens relative to wage income. As a result,
a growing share of income—particularly at the top of the distribution—either
entered the tax base in altered form or did not enter it immediately at all.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >A further
structural factor shaped the revenue pattern. OBRA-93 imposed a $1 million cap
on deductible executive compensation under IRC §162(m), with an exception for
performance-based pay. Intended to restrain high salaries, the provision
instead altered how compensation was structured and reported. Firms shifted
away from cash wages toward stock options and other equity-linked pay, which
expanded rapidly in its wake. When those options were exercised, compensation
was reported as wage income, while subsequent gains reflected in the sale of
shares were taxed as capital gains.</span> <span >The
policy thus redirected compensation into forms with greater timing flexibility
and preferential treatment, producing effects opposite to its stated aim. This
episode underscores the capacity of high-income earners to recharacterize
income in response to targeted measures, even when nominal compensation limits
are tightened.</span> <span >Combined
with the 1997 reduction in the capital gains rate, this change in compensation
structure contributed materially to the late-1990s surge in realizations and
high-end reported income. The episode illustrates how base and reporting
dynamics, not higher statutory rates, were central to the decade’s revenue
outcomes. Tables 33 and 34 document these movements in capital gains, reported
incomes, and receipts across the decade.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Evidently,
revenues did trend upward, but this does not imply that higher top-end rates
had greater effectiveness in promoting economic expansion or sustaining revenue
growth. From 1993 through 1996, total federal receipts averaged 17.67 percent
of GDP, virtually identical to the 17.68 percent average during the Reagan
years. Individual income tax revenues averaged 7.8 percent of GDP during</span><span

percent under </span><span class=whitespace-normal><span style='font-family:

Removing the timing-sensitive bracket creep years of 1981 to 1982 and isolating
1987 to 1988 after TRA-86 substantially reduced the top marginal rate amplifies
these phenomena. The individual income tax averaged roughly 8 percent of GDP
while total federal receipts averaged about 17.8 percent, levels higher than
the mid-1990s.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In 1997, the
statutory long-term capital gains rate was reduced from 28 percent to 20
percent, with additional holding-period adjustments that left many realized
gains subject to even lower effective rates. Following the rate reduction,
realizations accelerated. Individual income tax receipts subsequently rose to
9.3 percent of GDP during Clinton’s second term and averaged 8.55 percent over
his presidency as a whole. Even allowing for the extraordinary asset-market
gains of the late 1990s, the increase in revenues occurred after the rate cut
rather than immediately after the preceding increase. Measured against GDP,
federal receipts during the mid-1990s were comparable to those observed during
the Reagan years, despite materially different marginal rate structures.
Although top marginal rates were higher for much of the Reagan presidency,
capital gains rates were materially lower, and isolating the post-TRA-86 steady
state yields revenue levels that remain above those observed in the mid-1990s.
As throughout this study, revenue outcomes are not treated as a proxy for
economic health, but solely as a basis for cross-period comparison.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Using static
scoring, it is trivially true that revenues would have been lower absent the
1993 rate increases. Static scoring is designed to produce that conclusion: by
construction, any rate reduction “loses” revenue and any rate increase “raises”
it, regardless of what actually happens. This is not an empirical finding; it
is an accounting identity. Ignoring behavioral responses (ETI) yields distorted
revenue projections and a history of serial forecasting errors. If statutory
rates were cut in half and receipts doubled, static scoring would still record
a “revenue loss.” The same holds in reverse when rates increase. The evidence
reviewed here reveals the central problem: a framework that forbids behavioral
change cannot illuminate how tax policy affects real-world revenue. Table 34
shows the revenue trends across Clinton’s presidency.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Aggregate
federal receipts follow the same trend. Revenue growth in the first half of the
1990s was modest following the 1993 rate increase, rising in line with a
recovering economy but showing no distinctive acceleration attributable to
higher marginal rates. The sharp upward break occurred later in the decade,
coinciding with the 1997 capital gains rate reduction, the technology-driven
equity boom, and unprecedented realizations. Corporate receipts increased as
profits expanded during the late-1990s boom, though their trajectory was more
volatile than that of individual income taxes.</span> <span style='font-family:

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Just as it
is essential to recognize that President Reagan governed with a Democratic
House, it is equally important to recall the congressional landscape of the
Clinton years. Democrats controlled both chambers during Clinton’s first two
years; for the remaining six, Republicans held majorities in the House and
Senate—ushering in the first Republican-controlled House in forty years. Congress
played a decisive role in reshaping fiscal incentives during this period. Among
its most consequential legislation was the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, a bipartisan welfare-reform measure
enacted by the 104th Congress. The broader fiscal environment also differed
sharply from earlier eras. With no major military conflicts and the effective
completion of the Savings and Loan resolution process by the mid-1990s, both
defense spending and total federal outlays declined as a share of GDP
throughout Clinton’s presidency. These institutional and budgetary conditions
contributed materially to the fiscal results of the late 1990s and must be
considered when assessing the revenue trajectory of the period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >Among the major
legislation enacted by the 105th Congress was the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
(TRA-97). The law excluded up to $250,000 in gains from the sale of a primary
residence for each spouse, created Roth IRAs, and—most consequentially—reduced
capital gains tax rates. That change played a central role in the surge of
realized gains and the associated rise in federal receipts in the latter half
of the decade. A separate but related development, the 1996 welfare-reform act,
also strengthened work incentives and contributed to the general labor-market
improvements of the period.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >As noted,
Clinton’s first term raised the top marginal rate, but his second term moved in
the opposite direction. Major legislation during this period lowered the
overall tax burden. Although the administration did not articulate a distinct
economic doctrine, the prevailing mix of policy—lower investment taxes,
strengthened work incentives, restrained spending, and sound monetary policy—created
favorable conditions for productivity and growth. The late-1990s expansion
emerged in this environment. With robust output gains, rising productivity, and
congressional limits on outlays, the federal budget recorded surpluses from
1998 through 2001. Because appropriations originated in a Republican-controlled
Congress during Clinton’s final six years, these surpluses were inherently
bipartisan; assigning credit between the administration and Congress is
ultimately interpretive. A wider confluence of conditions shaped the
exceptional performance of the late decade; Table 35 highlights the primary
indicators during this period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >The data from
the 1990s complete the empirical arc traced throughout the twentieth century.
The decade’s strongest gains in income, employment, and federal receipts
occurred not in the aftermath of the 1993 rate increase but following the 1997
reductions in investment taxes, amid rising productivity and a stable monetary
environment. As in earlier episodes, taxpayers adjusted their behavior
predictably when marginal rates changed, and high-end realizations responded
sharply to lower capital gains rates. The late-1990s expansion thus aligns with
the historical pattern documented across this study: fiscal capacity is
strengthened not by imposing higher statutory burdens but by reducing the
penalties on work, reporting, and investment in an environment of monetary
stability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >By 2000, the
income tax had been tested under nearly every configuration a statutory system
can encounter: steeply progressive wartime schedules, peacetime surcharges,
broad-based cuts, structural reforms, bracket creep, indexing, and shifts in
the definition of taxable income itself. These contrasts supply the variation needed
to evaluate how the system behaves in practice. The conclusion turns from
episodes to the evidentiary patterns they collectively reveal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >This study
concludes its analysis in the year 2000. The subsequent twenty-five years add
remarkably little to what the prior century has already made clear. The
behavioral patterns identified here continue to appear in the subsequent
decades. But the post-2000 period introduces a series of smaller, more frequent
policy adjustments and significant macroeconomic shocks that make it less
suitable for isolating the effects of structural reform. For a study concerned
with the long-run consequences of major reforms, 2000 offers the last
analytically clean point at which the effects of earlier legislation can be
evaluated without the confounding influences that dominate the subsequent
decades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span >What began as a
minimal, uniform duty designed to finance the essential functions of the
federal government has evolved into something far removed from its original
conception. The constitutional standard of uniformity was set aside by statute
in 1913 and replaced by a new framework grounded in “ability to pay.” Within
five years, top marginal rates exceeded 70 percent—levels that would prevail,
with only brief interruptions, for most of the next sixty-five years. World War
I supplied the initial rationale for extending the burden downward, and the
emergency rates that followed became a semi-permanent feature of the modern
code. The corrective interval from 1925 to 1931 briefly restored a narrower tax
base in which only the affluent bore a meaningful income tax liability, but by
the early 1930s, exemptions had again fallen, rates had climbed, and the reach
of the tax resumed its downward expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;
background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >To be sure,
the economic and institutional context of the earlier periods examined bears
little resemblance to that of the present day. Federal responsibilities have
expanded substantially, and the scope of public provision has widened across
successive regimes.</span> <span >Yet the
magnitude and direction of these shifts underscore how far the system has moved
from the original principles of uniformity, narrow application, and minimal
intrusion that characterized its earliest form. Over much of this period, tax
policy has rested more on theoretical commitments than on observed results. And
when nearly a century’s worth of raw filing data is examined side by side with
the statutory changes that produced it, the same sweeping conclusions emerge
again and again. The behavioral responses visible in the data are not novel
discoveries; they are the very reactions anticipated by thinkers from Hume and
Smith to Mellon, Coolidge, and Keynes. The modern record has simply made those
earlier insights measurable over a century of varying policy regimes.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >In spite of
the empirical record, current debates over fiscal policy continue to rest on
premises already articulated during the 1930s, without sufficient attention to
the limits of taxation itself. Much of the modern redistributive case assumes
that pretax inequality has widened to such a degree that aggressive fiscal
intervention is both necessary and corrective. But the evidence assembled here
shows how readily apparent inequality can be overstated—or misattributed—when
structural shifts in the tax base, changes in reporting behavior, and timing
responses to rate changes are conflated with changes in underlying economic
well-being. When reported top-end income reflects reclassification, accelerated
realizations, or the migration of business entities into the individual tax
system, the tax code is being asked to correct a condition the data do not
clearly substantiate.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This is not
to deny the existence of genuine economic disparities, nor to offer a
comprehensive account of the inequality literature. It is to emphasize that tax
return data, particularly during periods of major statutory change, do not
furnish a stable measure of those disparities. Expansions of the tax base, the
removal of deductions and shelters, and atypical concentrations of realizations
will mechanically widen observed distributional gaps even when the underlying
resources available to others have not changed commensurately. At the same
time, large and growing shares of transfer payments, in-kind benefits, and
employer-provided benefits received at the lower end of the distribution fall
outside pretax income altogether, further narrowing the measured base.</span> <span
>Much of what appears as increased
concentration is therefore an artifact of tax reform itself rather than a
deterioration in the economic position of lower-income Americans. Treating such
artifacts as evidence of structural inequality places an interpretive burden on
the data that they cannot bear and risks assigning redistributive power to a
tool that the historical record shows to be ill-suited to resolve pretax inequalities.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Over the
past half century, technological change, globalization, and rising returns to
skill and capital have materially altered the dispersion of market incomes.
These forces, however, operate largely outside the tax system itself and cannot
be inferred mechanically from tax return data—particularly during periods in
which statutory changes, reporting incentives, and entity classification are in
flux. The argument here is therefore not that inequality is merely a
statistical mirage, but that the income tax is a blunt and often misleading
instrument for identifying its magnitude or sources. Once this distinction is
observed, claims that tax reductions themselves generate socially harmful
inequality require a further assumption about how additional after-tax income
is deployed. Absent evidence of systematic rent extraction or distortion, it
cannot be assumed that greater after-tax income dispersion implies welfare
destruction, as voluntary exchange ordinarily links income to mutually agreed
transactions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Notwithstanding
the evidence that a particular mix of monetary restraint and incentive-based
tax policy has repeatedly aligned with strong economic outcomes across three
major American iterations, it cannot be claimed that tax cuts alone “caused”
the subsequent expansions. What can be concluded—consistently and without
qualification—is that taxpayers adjust their behavior when incentives change.
Across each episode, lower marginal rates were associated with substantially
more income being reported by upper-income tax units, alongside higher income
tax collections from that group. At the other end of the distribution, tax
liability declined for less affluent tax units. This two-sided pattern appears
in every major reform analyzed in this study and remains durable across
differences in era, political environment, and broader economic conditions.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >If this
still seems counterintuitive, a further empirical regularity warrants
attention. Since 1944, individual income tax receipts have averaged roughly 7.9
percent of GDP despite top marginal rates that have ranged from 94 percent to
28 percent. Across radically different statutory structures and economic
environments, the income tax has persistently yielded roughly the same share of
national output. If elevated marginal tax rates reliably expanded fiscal
capacity, this figure would have moved decisively. Evidently, it has not.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >Figure 6
highlights additional features of the historical record often overlooked in
contemporary debate. The frequently celebrated “golden age” of 1947–1973 did
not generate unusually high individual income tax receipts; they averaged only
about 7.4 percent of GDP. The common feature across these episodes is not merely
elevated statutory rates but the contraction of the high-income tax base they
induce: punitive rates suppress top-level income reporting, reducing revenues
from the very cohort they are intended to target. Long before the modern income
tax, David Hume warned of the futility and counterproductive effects of such
systems: “But the most pernicious of all taxes are those which are arbitrary. <span
style='color:black'>They are commonly converted by their management into
punishments on industry; and also by their unavoidable inequality are more
grievous than by the real burden which they impose. It is surprising,
therefore, to see them have place among any civilized people.” <a href="#_ftn81"

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >By contrast,
the lower-rate regime of the Reagan era produced revenues of roughly 8.2
percent of GDP—on a much larger economic base. That average includes 1981 and
1982, when bracket creep was still unwinding and inflation remained elevated.
Excluding those two transition years, individual income tax receipts from 1983
through 1988 averaged about 7.8 percent of GDP—above the 1947–1973 figure and
essentially identical to the longer-run post-1944 mean. Peaks in revenue share
coincide not with high statutory rates but with extraordinary or unstable
conditions: the financing of World War II; the inflationary surge of the late
1960s; the stagflation years culminating in 1982; and the post-COVID rebound
driven by one-time realizations and acute nominal growth. The late 1990s stand
out as the only period in which revenues rose markedly amid a relatively stable
macroeconomic environment with exceptional gains in real output. Over a century
of data underscore that tax receipts are not a proxy for underlying economic health,
a distinction maintained throughout this analysis.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >These
phenomena have been recognized abroad. Across advanced economies, the shift
toward lower marginal rates was not confined to the United States. As the OECD
documents, the OECD-wide average top statutory personal income tax rate fell
from 66 percent in 1981 to 42 percent in 2010.<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>82</span></a> Although some countries
introduced modest increases following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009,
none of the G7 economies has returned to the 60–70 percent top-rate structure
that prevailed before the 1980s.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >International
comparisons reveal behavioral responses consistent with those identified in
this study. While such comparisons cannot, by themselves, identify precise
causal mechanisms absent detailed institutional reconstruction, the repeated
association between marginal rate reductions and improved growth and revenue
performance across diverse countries strongly suggests that incentive effects
are not uniquely American. The U.S.-based analysis presented here demonstrates
those mechanisms directly using primary data, while the international evidence
indicates that they recur across a wide range of institutional settings.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >The data
undermine the common assertion that higher statutory rates are the most
effective means of ensuring that the affluent pay their “fair share.”
Redistribution hinges not on statutory rates themselves but on whether the tax
structure expands the base available to be taxed or suppresses it. Systems that
encourage greater reporting at the top necessarily generate more revenue for
any redistributive purpose. Policies grounded in incentive-based principles
strengthen marginal returns to reporting income, work, saving, and investment,
thereby expanding the economic base and, as a secondary consequence, raising
fiscal capacity while reducing deadweight loss. With the individual income tax
persistently yielding roughly 7.9 percent of GDP, durable increases in
resources available for public purposes depend on sustained growth in output
itself. Disagreements over how to apportion statutory burdens will persist, but
they do not alter this arithmetic constraint or the practical limits of fiscal
policy.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >It is not
implied that fiscal or monetary policy can be reduced to a single lever, nor
that the episodes examined here function as controlled experiments. The 1920s,
early 1960s, 1980s, and late 1990s differed in circumstances, scale, and
political context. Yet they share a family resemblance: each featured lower
marginal tax rates alongside restored monetary stability and a policy
orientation aimed at growth. Such recurrences do not constitute experimental
proof, but they do provide consistent indications of underlying behavioral
regularities. This repeated alignment between incentives and outcomes is what
separates a principle from a mere assertion. As Armen Alchian and William Allen
put it: “Principles form a ‘science’ if people can deduce from those principles
consequences as a result of specified initial events. If those implied
consequences happen reliably, that set of principles is a ‘science.’” <a
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>83</span></a></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >This study
has not attempted to overturn the extensive literature on income distribution
or to substitute a new theory of taxation for the old. Its aim has been more
modest and, in some respects, more fundamental: to examine what the tax record
shows when the mechanics of reporting, the incentives embedded in statute, and
definitional shifts within the tax base are carefully accounted for. Across the
historical episodes reviewed here, from the reinstitution of the income tax in
1913 to the reforms of the 1990s, tax data consistently reflect the statutory
frameworks that generate them. Each episode tells its own story, but in every
case the law itself has been inseparable from the observed results.</span> <span
>Reported income is not an independent
barometer of economic conditions; it is a behavioral and statutory construct.
When the rules change, the data change. Any interpretation that treats the
resulting figures as neutral measures of economic reality risks mistaking
artifacts of policy design for underlying trends.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span >What this
inquiry adds is a systematic accounting of how those mechanisms operate
cumulatively across the twentieth-century income tax: the reclassification of
income in response to marginal rates; the timing of realizations when capital gains
schedules shift; the migration of business income across entities; changes in
participation as brackets expand or contract; and the erosion and
reconstruction of the tax base itself. These dynamics have long been
acknowledged in principle but rarely traced through the full historical record.
The evidence presented here suggests that many familiar narratives about who
gained, who lost, and why revenues rose or fell are incomplete without
attention to these underlying forces. This study does not propose a preferred
tax system. It instead establishes empirical constraints on what income
taxation has historically been able to achieve. Any future proposal that
assumes stable reporting, neutral participation, or mechanically progressive
outcomes must reconcile those assumptions with the record documented here. A
clearer record does not resolve every debate, nor does it eliminate
uncertainty. But by distinguishing the structural from the behavioral, and the
real from the statistical, it provides a more accurate foundation for assessing
what tax policy has accomplished, what it has not, and what it cannot.</span></p>
