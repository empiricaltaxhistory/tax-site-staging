    <h1>An Empirical History of the U.S. Income Tax</h1>
    <h2>
      Federal income tax analysis based on primary-source data and explicit arithmetic,
      from constitutional foundations through the modern era.
    </h2>

    <p>
      This site hosts an empirical analysis of the United States federal income tax, beginning
      with constitutional debates and early fiscal ideas that predate the Sixteenth Amendment,
      and extending through the major statutory regimes of the twentieth century.
      The project relies on original IRS Statistics of Income tables, statutory rate schedules,
      exemptions, filing thresholds, and contemporaneous macroeconomic aggregates. Claims are
      evaluated through direct computation and comparison rather than narrative inference.
    </p>

    <p>
      The analysis examines how tax systems operated in practice: how many tax units filed, what income was reported,
      how did revenues follow, under what definitions, and with what observable behavioral responses.
      Particular attention is paid to changes in tax bases, reporting incentives, and
      participation thresholds that complicate simple comparisons over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project studies tax mechanics and their relationship to reported income, taxable
      bases, and broader measures of economic activity. Analysis is confined to quantities
      directly reported or computable from primary tax records and statutory definitions.
