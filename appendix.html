    <h2 id="appendix-a-methodology">Appendix A: Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      This study employs a consistent empirical framework to evaluate behavioral responses to
      major statutory and structural changes in federal income-tax policy from 1913 to 2000,
      a period in which continuous and internally consistent data permit meaningful cross-era
      comparison. Earlier episodes (1861–1872 and 1894–1895) are addressed briefly to provide
      the constitutional and philosophical foundation for the modern system. Because statutory
      definitions, periods of persistent inflation, administrative practices, and data reporting
      standards change across time, the analysis relies on a unified set of conventions designed
      to maximize comparability while maintaining fidelity to the underlying sources. These
      conventions are described below.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Inflation Adjustments</h3>
    <p>
      All nominal values are converted to constant 2017 dollars using official Bureau of Labor
      Statistics series. For 1913 through 1976 the analysis uses the Consumer Price Index for All
      Urban Consumers (CPI-U), and for 1977 onward the analysis relies on the Consumer Price
      Index Research Series (CPI-U-RS). CPI-U-RS is chosen for the post-1977 period because it
      provides a backward-consistent index that incorporates modern methodological
      improvements. Using the CPI-U/CPI-U-RS combination preserves comparability while
      avoiding discontinuities introduced by post-hoc revisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      All deflation is performed on a calendar-year basis. Where IRS Statistics of Income (SOI)
      data are published in current dollars, income amounts and revenue aggregates are
      converted to constant 2017 dollars. Statutory bracket thresholds are shown in real terms
      only for comparison across periods and do not represent indexed brackets prior to 1985.
      Throughout the manuscript, whole-numbered tables report values in nominal dollars, while
      decimal-numbered tables report the same series in constant 2017 dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macroeconomic aggregates reported by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
      including revenues, outlays, and debt, are expressed using GDP price indices rather than
      CPI-based deflators and are reported on a fiscal-year basis. Where GDP-deflated series are
      used, they are presented as shares of gross domestic product rather than converted to
      CPI-adjusted dollar levels. As a result, real-dollar values derived from GDP-deflated sources
      differ modestly from CPI-U or CPI-U-RS conversions, although comparative trends and
      relationships are unaffected.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Primary Tax Data Sources</h3>
    <p>
      The principal source for taxpayer behavior is the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of
      Income (SOI), including Individual Income Tax Returns, Net Income tables, Adjusted Gross
      Income tables, Revenue tables, and Historical Table 1 where applicable. The analysis relies
      exclusively on tables published contemporaneously or in the IRS’s annual compilations,
      without reconstruction or retroactive adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because SOI data reflect reported taxable income rather than total economic income, the
      analysis treats SOI values as behavioral indicators. Reported income rises or falls in
      response to incentives, definitions, and enforcement environments; it does not directly
      measure underlying economic inequality. This distinction is fundamental to the
      interpretive framework of the manuscript.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Income Definitions and Comparability</h3>
    <p>
      Across the century covered here, income definitions change substantially. Until 1943, the
      IRS reported Net Income After Credits, which differs from post-1944 Adjusted Gross Income
      (AGI). The Revenue Act of 1944 introduced AGI and reorganized the tax base accordingly.
      Later reforms further complicate comparisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tax Reform Act of 1986 represents a major definitional break, eliminating numerous
      shelters, limiting passive losses, altering depreciation rules, and reclassifying certain
      categories of income. As a result, AGI values reported prior to 1986 are not directly
      comparable to AGI values after 1986. This study treats TRA86 as the single most important
      measurement discontinuity in the postwar series and interprets post-1986 increases in
      high-income AGI with appropriate caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      No attempt is made to create a synthetic harmonized series; instead, discontinuities are
      acknowledged explicitly where they affect interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Tax-Rate Data</h3>
    <p>
      Statutory rates are drawn from the Treasury Department’s “Individual Income Tax Rates
      and Tax Shares” and accompanying Historical Rate Schedules. These schedules show
      normal tax, surtax, exemptions, bracket thresholds, and marginal rates. Because statutory
      rates differ from effective burdens, the analysis treats rate schedules as indicators of
      marginal incentive structures, not as summaries of actual tax payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      All comparisons involving rate changes are grounded in statutory legislation, which is
      identified where comprehensive changes to the tax code are enacted. Throughout the
      manuscript, references to “tax cuts” denote statutory reductions in marginal tax rates. They
      do not imply reductions in aggregate liabilities or receipts, which depend on income
      composition, behavioral response, and macroeconomic conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Revenue, Spending, and Macroeconomic Data</h3>
    <p>
      Macroeconomic aggregates—receipts, outlays, deficits, debt, unemployment, real GDP
      growth, and inflation—are taken from the Office of Management and Budget Historical
      Tables, the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts, and the
      Bureau of Labor Statistics. All fiscal aggregates are expressed as shares of gross domestic
      product where possible to permit consistent comparison across eras of differing nominal
      scales, population sizes, and price levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because OMB tables are reported on a fiscal-year basis, while SOI data reflect calendar
      years, the analysis treats each series within its own temporal conventions without attempt
      to force artificial alignment. Historical GDP series prior to the availability of modern BEA
      tables draw on BEA reconstructions and Measuring Worth where necessary; these series use
      GDP price indices rather than CPI deflators.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Behavioral Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The analysis views taxpayer responses through the lens of behavioral economics and
      public-finance research. Because individuals optimize along the margins defined by
      statutory rates, deductions, exemptions, and shelter availability, reported income is treated
      as a function of the incentive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is consistent with empirical literature on the elasticity of reported income
      (ETI), which captures how taxable income responds to changes in marginal rates. ETI-based
      reasoning is used here to interpret movements in high-income reporting across the century,
      but the manuscript does not assign a fixed elasticity parameter. Instead, it draws on
      observed changes in SOI values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capital gains realizations are treated as behavioral responses to statutory rate changes
      rather than as measures of underlying wealth accumulation. Spikes and collapses in
      reported gains are interpreted as timing effects unless corroborated by sustained changes
      in income shares or receipts.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Treatment of Non-Filers, Base Erosion, and Tax Units</h3>
    <p>
      SOI data reflect tax units that file returns; non-filers do not appear. In periods where
      exemptions rise substantially (notably 1925–1931), millions of low-income individuals
      cease filing, reducing the count of returns but not the underlying population. This
      manuscript estimates the magnitude of “missing filers” where relevant but does not impute
      income to non-filers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis instead focuses on documented changes within the filing population. Patterns
      of base erosion, bracket creep, and shelter use are discussed where statutory or inflationary
      conditions encourage them. The term “tax unit” refers to a filing return as recorded in SOI
      data; “taxpayer” or “earner” is used only when describing behavioral decision-making rather
      than accounting outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Legislative and Institutional Context</h3>
    <p>
      Because tax rules evolve within a constitutional and institutional framework, this study
      incorporates legislative history from presidential messages, congressional debates,
      committee reports, voting results, and statutory language. The analysis respects the
      constitutional allocation of revenue-raising authority to the House of Representatives and
      situates tax enactments within the political alignments of each period.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contextualization is descriptive rather than normative; the manuscript avoids
      attributing motive except where documentary evidence clearly supports it.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Scope and Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      The study primarily limits itself to federal income tax behavior and does not evaluate
      payroll taxes, state and local taxation, or wealth effects except where these intersect
      directly with federal incentives. Corporate, state, and local taxes are noted where material.
      The analysis does not attempt to measure “true” economic inequality; the manuscript’s
      claims are confined to what the federal income-tax system records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Causal claims are made cautiously, with explicit recognition that macroeconomic outcomes
      result from interacting monetary, fiscal, demographic, and external factors. When
      attribution is uncertain, the manuscript states so explicitly.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Replicability</h3>
    <p>
      All data used in this study are publicly available from IRS SOI, OMB, BEA, and BLS.
      Spreadsheet formulas for deflation, percentage changes, and series alignment use standard
      arithmetic procedures documented directly in the manuscript's tables. The conversion
      methods, deflators, and comparability notes provided here are sufficient for replicating
      every table and figure in the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the historical IRS Statistics of Income data used in this study—particularly for the
      period prior to mid-century digitization—required manual extraction from original Bureau
      of Internal Revenue and IRS publications. Appendix B reproduces these primary tables in
      their original published format to preserve contemporaneous definitions, reporting
      conventions, and internal structure, and to allow independent verification without the risk
      of transcription or normalization drift.
